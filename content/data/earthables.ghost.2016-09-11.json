Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started.

My point here is to say that anything is possible, but not everything is *probable*. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So why are wings, a jetpack and a rekindled relationship improbable with the Law of Attraction? Simple.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>*You don’t expect to have them.*</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In order to have anything (including the wings and the trips to the moon), only one thing has to change, and that is your expectation.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">With the Law of Attraction, we create our reality through our expectation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When we see ourselves as lovable, love comes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When we don’t, it stays far, far away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is why getting an ex back can be challenging in the midst of a breakup.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>After someone has stomped on your heart and rejected you, it can be hard to see yourself as lovable.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you are beaten down and feeling badly, you simply aren’t in a state of expecting love to happen to you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This is why people get so sad when they are dumped.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>That former hopefulness has evaporated, and it has been replaced by an expectation of loneliness and despair.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[14 Things to Stop Saying Now if You Want to Find Love](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/12/03/if-you-want-to-find-love/ \"find love article\")“***\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For this reason, when I work with people who want to get an ex back, I make it 100% clear from the beginning that letting the ex go is the most important thing that needs to be done.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">*This doesn’t mean you’ll never get him or her back, *it simply means that from where you stand (energetically speaking) it is probably just about impossible to expect that this person will come back, and this lack of expectation pushes the old partner further away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To clarify this point, let me offer a very common human experience:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Imagine you have a friend who went on a couple of dates with a guy and she ju</span><span class=\"s1\">st can’t get him out of her head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She texts him constantly, follows him around and flirts shamelessly to get his attention. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">But instead of falling head over heels in love with her, what happens? He runs for the hills!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Now your friend is sad and down for a long time, and she becomes obsessed with getting him back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She talks about the situation endlessly, and now she’s asking your advice on how to get him back.The situation just becomes more and more desperate, and the guy in question is only getting further and further away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then finally, one day she decides she’s sick of obsessing about this guy and that she’s ready to move on.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She picks herself up, and gets back out on the dating scene. She works on her happiness and gets her energy back on track.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then what happens? </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Suddenly, Prince Charming is back sniffing around again! He texts her and calls her and tries to win back her affections. Now that she’s moved on and back to feeling good about herself, he wants to take her on a date again. Oh the irony!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Chances are you know someone who has experienced this phenomena (and maybe you’ve even experienced it yourself!).</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">See, when we allow ourselves to let go of people we have been chasing after, we stop focusing on our expectation of being unlovable, and this allows love to come to us much more easily. We put our focus on loving ourselves, and this focus attracts love back into our life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So if you’ve been wanting to get an ex back, do yourself a favor. Make it your new goal to get over your ex, and see what happens.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Maybe the ex will come back, maybe you’ll find a new love interest, but for SURE you will start feeling better and you will release a lot of the energy that is preventing you from developing the expectation you need to find true love.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Letting go of your ex is a necessary step on the path to finding love after heartbreak.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[5 Possible Reasons Why You’re Still Single](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/13/reasons-why-youre-still-single/ \"Why You're Still Single Article\")“***\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So to answer the question “can you get your ex back with the Law of Attraction?” the answer is a resounding YES.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, it is done through letting go, not through trying.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To all my friends out there licking their wounds and feeling bad about love, take heart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You don’t have to work to get him or her back. You don’t need to strategize or think about it. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You only have to do one thing, and that is to let him or her go by doing whatever you can do to get over it. Fortunately, there are a lots of ways you can use the Law of Attraction to help you let go and get your happy back.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you are<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>truly ready to let go and make your happiness your #1 priority, events and circumstances will shift in your life. You will start loving yourself again, and the universe will respond by bringing more love into your life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>All you have to do is put yourself first.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you have any questions about love and the Law of Attraction, feel free to**[contact me](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/contact-raise-your-vibration-today/ \"Contact me here\")**and let me know how I can help.

Wow, I really don’t ever want to be someone’s trap queen…I really don’t even understand what that is.\n\nAs I witness some of our generation slowly begin to wake up, it gives me hope that we could be remembered for something great.

Where is the spontaneity in that? The romance? No where. Dating as a sport isn’t going to get you any closer to ‘the one’. Dating someone who isn’t right for you just for the sake of dating will lead you nowhere but straight into disaster. Work on loving who you are and bettering yourself everyday, then the right person for you will come along.\n- **The Ego is Taking Over. **Part of the ego is sometimes recognized as arrogance. Boy, does our generation have a sh*t ton of that. It’s all about status, money, and how many followers you have on Twitter. An overboard of selfies so a bunch of people you may or may not know can tell you how awesome you are. The other part of the ego is insecurity. Feeling insecure when you see a beautiful picture of someone else or jealousy of how someones lifestyle is displayed through imagery.\n- **Lack of Respect For One’s Self. **Sleeping around, posting half naked pictures, and pretending to be someone you are not is all just disrespecting yourself. Giving someone your mind, your body, and your soul is a beautiful experience and we suck the beauty right out of it. Sex is great and it is meant to be great, with the *right* person. A person who loves and respects you, not someone who just wants to feel great in the moment but for a *lifetime. *Wanna Netflix and chill? Nope, I want to turn off Netflix and make love, thank you very much.\n- **The World is at Our Fingertips. **Literally, by the click of a mouse we can instantly have anything we want. If we are hungry we can wait in a drive-thru for a few minutes or have it delivered to our doorsteps. Need clothes? Order them online! Millions of apps and Google search help us to not have to work for anything. Why work at being in love for a lifetime, when you can experience it in one night?\n- **Partying is More Important Than Building Lasting Relationships. **All our generation cares about is drugs and alcohol. An instant feeling of numbness to take away emotional pain, not having to face it and work through your issues is addicting. Some people drink and do drugs to intensify emotions of love and sexual desire, creating an illusion of what it’s actually really like to love someone. Thus, to work for love or wait for a lasting union is not needed.\n- **We Don’t Know How to Love. **Love has and always will be complex. Our generation isn’t the only one in history who are confused by this phenomena. Love is scary,  it makes you vulnerable and susceptible to the worst kind of pain you have ever felt. Contrary to this, love is beautiful, selfless and inspiring. Most love stories aren’t fairy tales, people have to work for it and *wait* for it. Are you willing to begin to understand love for what it actually is? Or, would you rather pretend it to be something it is not just so you can get a quick, but false taste?\n\nI’ve experienced first hand some of the issues I listed above, I’ll admit it.

connection with your Zodiac sign?  According to your sign, your pet peeves and the types of things that irritate you can be found in the stars.  Check out your sign and see if it matches up with the things that bother you:</span>\n\n**Aquarius – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ignorance, particularly in those who you think should know better.  Aquarians are progressive, meaning they can’t stand those people who make unfair assumptions about the random nature of life.</span>\n\n**Pisces – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who don’t understand where you’re coming from.  Pisces don’t enjoy sharp criticism; they hate when they’re trying to explain something and their friends can’t seem to get it.</span>\n\n**Aries – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You despise people who take </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forever</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get anything done.  This sounds like my roommate, he’s always nagging me to get ready quicker because he’s been ready since 15 minutes before we decided on anything.</span>\n\n**Taurus – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus are not a fan of change to their routines.  You don’t enjoy friend groups that are full of drama.  Change can be ok, unless it goes so far as to set you back to starting all over again.</span>\n\n**Gemini – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini is not

(“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.[heartcenteredrebalancing.com](http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/) (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.\n\n### What Information Do We Collect?\n\nThe information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.\n\n#### User Content\n\nSome features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n#### IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically\n\nWe automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).\n\nGenerally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n\n#### Email Communications\n\nWe may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.\n\n#### Information Collected Using Cookies\n\nCookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.\n\nOur cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.\n\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.\n\n#### Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons\n\nTo support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.\n\nAdvertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.\n\nTo increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\n#### Aggregate Information\n\nWe collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.\n\n### How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?\n\nThe Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.\n\n#### Public Information about Your Activity on the Services\n\nSome of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.\n\nPlease also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\n\n#### IP Address Information\n\nWhile we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.\n\n#### Information You Elect to Share\n\nYou may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.\n\n#### Aggregate Information\n\nWe share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.\n\n#### Information Shared with Our Agents\n\nWe employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.\n\n#### Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers\n\nIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n\n#### Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.\n\n#### Information We Share With Your Consent\n\nExcept as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.\n\n### Is Information About Me Secure?\n\nWe store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.\n\n### What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?\n\nYou can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.\n\nYou can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.\n\n### What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?\n\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.\n\n### What If I Have Questions or Concerns?\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message through our Contact Us page.\n\n*Effective Date: 06-09-2013*\n\n \n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Heart Centered Rebalancing.

I grew up on old romantic movies and novels, I couldn’t wait to ***fall***. So, when I got older I tried to fall in love…a lot and very quickly. I wanted novel-like love, fairy-tale love, a love like Hollywood portrays. I thought love was an obsession with someone, not a commitment to them.\n\nMy unhealthy addiction with a delusional and false portrayal of love stems from a childhood of wanting to be loved. From being severely bullied to coming from a divorced family, I quickly and mistakenly learned to believe I could not be loved and if someone did love me, I did not believe them. I still hoped a ‘perfect’ and crazy kind of love existed, just not for me. It took a lot of heartbreak and stupid choices for me to understand the differences of being in love and *really *loving someone.\n\nI’m sharing this with you so you can connect with my humble journey of learning what it’s like to really love someone, to sacrifice an idea and a part of yourself to experience *real* love.\n\n***Falling In Love.***\n\nOh, gosh. It’s so sweet isn’t it? The first stages of wooing someone or being wooed. The all-consuming thoughts, manic energy and the feeling that maybe and finally you have met *the one*.  All you can think about is this mysterious human being, it is all you want to talk about. You feel you could move mountains, or at least climb one. You want it right now, there is no time to waste.\n\nThose feelings and emotions are overwhelming aren’t they? That first kiss that is brought to a halt due to a smile or a bashful giggle. You think to yourself, this person is everything I have ever wanted and I *need* them. Eventually, you come back to reality and realize this person too, has faults. They are not super-human, but just human.\n\n*Owning *someone or at least wanting to own a part of them to make yourself temporarily happy, is not actually loving someone. Own yourself and your identity, and you won’t *need* anyone.\n\nFalling ‘in love’ with someone is literally altering chemicals in your brain. In a matter of seconds after locking eyes with this person, your body starts to fall in love. In the first stages of being infatuated, all anyone talks about is how attractive the person they met is and you start to crave them like a drug. Hormones increase, pupils dilate, you become nauseous with anxiety just from thinking about them or the fact they just text you again…sound familiar?\n\nDon’t let your body chemistry trick you, everyone eventually comes down and then you are left there…wondering if this person is *really* right for you. Enjoy falling in love, but know that eventually you will start to feel different or fall right out of love with that person.\n\n***Loving Someone.***\n\nThis is a choice. Falling lead to real feeling and you chose to start a life with this wonderful person. By this point, you’ve met some of their flaws and probably have been annoyed with them a time or two, three, okay maybe four times. Loving this person means accepting them for their flaws and selflessly giving a part of yourself to them because you want them to be loved and for them to love you in return, despite your own issues.\n\nLoving someone doesn’t mean you won’t experience thoughts of immense love you have for this person, it just becomes more realistic. It may be a fleeting thought or racing heart thinking to yourself “I can’t believe this person loves me the way that they do, no matter what.” To me, that’s better than an endless stream of wild what ifs and anxiety-filled nights.\n\nYou will never own someone you truly love, you won’t want to. You want them to feel free and better themselves on a daily basis, to be confident in you and themselves. Jealousy is natural, but obsessive and controlling behavior is not real love. Everyone goes through it and everyone is guilty of being obsessive at least once. I don’t care if you hide it, the point is… you still do it. When you actually love someone, you won’t feel the need to act like this.\n\nIt’s not a chemical romance, it is real. You don’t need the constant high to remind you that you love them, it’s just there. You aren’t really searching for happiness elsewhere, you are content. Every decision you make, every hardship you face, and when you just need someone to listen, they are always there. You know that no matter what, you will always and forever love them.\n\nThere is no battle, there is only **love. **  \n**About the Author: **\n\n[**Kate Rae**](http://katerae.wordpress.com) is an intuitive writer discussing the world of mental illness and how healthy living and a little humor can greatly improve your well being.

React to Being Told They're Beautiful, Their Reaction Will Make You Cry","slug":"people-react-to-being-told-theyre-beautiful-their-reaction-will-make-you-cry","markdown":"\nIt’s the strangest phenomena to me, and I can admit that I am not outside of it.  I, generally-speaking, do not think that I am a very attractive person.  I boast of confidence and act as though not much bothers me, but that’s only because it’s easier to find happiness once you’ve accepted the reality of your life and start being yourself.\n\nHave you ever told someone that they’re beautiful?  I probably think it to myself at least a handful of times everyday when watching and interacting with the various people in my life, but I rarely ever voice it.  In both men and women I am able to look at them and find something attractive and beautiful about them.\n\nHow could you not?  Every single person on this planet is a unique, beautiful, stunning, miraculous bundle of tissue, nerves and consciousness.  And while I (and I assume many others) am able to see the beauty inherent within every person, I’d venture to guess that most of us don’t view ourselves that way.\n\nAn 18-year-old student from Chicago embarked on a high school project that would quickly become much larger than she had anticipated.  **[Shea Glover](https://www.instagram.com/gloverfull/)** invited students and teachers to pose for portraits; some of whom she knew, some of whom were total strangers.\n\nAs these people were standing in front of her camera, she would tell them the purpose of the project: “I’m taking pictures of things I find beautiful.”\n\nThe following video documented the beautiful, raw emotion that is expressed when people are caught a tiny bit off guard by being told they’re beautiful.  It is truly

person.  I boast of confidence and act as though not much bothers me, but that’s only because it’s easier to find happiness once you’ve accepted the reality of your life and start being yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever told someone that they’re beautiful?  I probably think it to myself at least a handful of times everyday when watching and interacting with the various people in my life, but I rarely ever voice it.  In both men and women I am able to look at them and find something attractive and beautiful about them.</p>\n\n<p>How could you not?  Every single person on this planet is a unique, beautiful, stunning, miraculous bundle of tissue, nerves and consciousness.  And while I (and I assume many others) am able to see the beauty inherent within every person, I’d venture to guess that most of us don’t view ourselves that way.</p>\n\n<p>An 18-year-old student from Chicago embarked on a high school project that would quickly become much larger than she had

video documented the beautiful, raw emotion that is expressed when people are caught a tiny bit off guard by being told they’re beautiful.  It is truly amazing the power that one word holds.  Watch

Difference?","slug":"soulmate-or-life-partner-do-you-know-the-difference","markdown":"\n**[Longing to find one’s soulmate](http://foreverconscious.com/why-do-we-seek-companionship)** is often the tale of many Disney films, romantic films, and fairy tales.  But the idea is so inherently good-natured and lovable.  Doesn’t everyone like to think that there is one person out there who is just absolutely perfect for them in every way?  It’s what keeps many of us chasing after true love, even after our hearts have been broken over and over again.\n\nWhat is a soulmate, though?  According to **[ForeverConscious](http://foreverconscious.com/the-difference-between-soulmates-and-life-partners)**, a soulmate is one who is aligned with your soul and is sent to challenge, awaken and stir different parts of your in order for your soul to transcend to higher levels of consciousness and awareness, and once the lesson has been learned, the two beings physically separate.\n\nA life partner is a companion and friend, a stable person who you can always rely on, trust, and depend on to help you through the trials of life.  You share a mutual love and respect for one another, always in sync, satisfying each others needs and desires.\n\nSoulmates appear in our lives at the exact moment when we need them.  When we are ready to learn one of the grand lessons in life, our soulmates are there to guide us toward the destiny we were meant to live.  Soulmate relationships typically do not stand the test of time, as they are typically too intense and possess a certain karmic energy necessary to close relationships once the lessons have been learned.\n\nThey are not always romantic partners, they can be friends or relatives.  You will, however, always feel a strong connection to these individuals, as you have a shared energy or a past life history with one another.\n\nOn the other hand, a life partner is someone who acts more as companion or friend.  While you might not feel that deep, soulful connection that you would normally with a soulmate, but a life partner provides a mutual trust and understanding of one another.  They respect your desires and needs and love and care for you.\n\nManifesting a life partner in your life is not a spiritual process like with our soulmates.  They are there to provide support and guidance as you continue on your own journey through life, just as you are there for them in the same way.  Meeting your life partner happens when you are both emotionally and mentally prepared, putting yourself into the world with confidence in your being.\n\n**[It is not impossible for a soulmate to become a life partner](http://foreverconscious.com/why-you-may-not-want-to-marry-your-soulmate)** and life partners are fully capable for developing deep, soulful connections, it all depends on the specific people and circumstances.\n\nCheck out the different characteristics of each type of relationship:\n\n**Soulmate Relationship**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You feel a deep, spiritual connection to this person almost like you have known them for a long time.</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have flashbacks or deja vu moments where you feel that you have been together before.</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You seem to understand each other and have a similar way of thinking.</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have similar flaws or habits, or you both had similar challenges during childhood.</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your connection is intense and so too is the relationship.

 It’s what keeps many of us chasing after true love, even after our hearts have been broken over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>What is a soulmate, though?  According to <strong><a href=\"http://foreverconscious.com/the-difference-between-soulmates-and-life-partners\">ForeverConscious</a></strong>, a soulmate is one who is aligned with your soul and is sent to challenge, awaken and stir different parts of your in order for your soul to transcend to higher levels of consciousness and awareness, and once the lesson has been learned, the two beings physically separate.</p>\n\n<p>A life partner is a companion and friend, a stable person who you can always rely on, trust, and depend on to help you through the trials of life.  You share a mutual love and respect for one another, always in sync, satisfying each others needs and desires.</p>\n\n<p>Soulmates appear in our lives at the exact moment when we need them.  When we are ready to learn one of the grand lessons in life, our soulmates are there to guide us toward the destiny we were meant to live.  Soulmate relationships typically do not stand the test of time, as they are typically too intense and possess a certain karmic energy necessary to close relationships once the lessons have been learned.</p>\n\n<p>They are not always romantic partners, they can be friends or relatives.  You will, however, always feel a strong connection to these individuals, as you have a shared energy or a past life history with one another.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a life partner is someone who acts more as companion or friend.  While you might not feel that deep, soulful connection that you would normally with a soulmate, but a life partner provides a mutual trust and understanding of one another.  They respect your desires and needs and love and care for you.</p>\n\n<p>Manifesting a life partner in your life is not a spiritual process like with our soulmates.  They are there to provide support and guidance as you continue on your own journey through life, just as you are there for them in the same way.  Meeting your life partner happens when you are both emotionally and mentally prepared, putting yourself into the world with confidence in your being.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://foreverconscious.com/why-you-may-not-want-to-marry-your-soulmate\">It is not impossible for a soulmate to become a life partner</a></strong> and life partners are fully capable for developing deep, soulful connections, it all depends on the specific people and circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the different characteristics of each type of relationship:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soulmate Relationship</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You feel a deep, spiritual connection to this person almost like you have known them for a long time.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have flashbacks or deja vu moments where you feel that you have been together before.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You seem to understand each other and have a similar way of thinking.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have similar flaws or habits, or you both had similar challenges during childhood.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your connection is intense and so too is the relationship.

Your Zodiac Sign Says About Your Needs in a Relationship","slug":"what-your-zodiac-sign-says-about-your-needs-in-a-relationship","markdown":"\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships are no walk in the park, especially when it comes to navigating the differences between signs.  Every relationship needs to have that spark or special quality that keeps the passion and love fueled and burning.  See what your Zodiac sign has to say about your needs in a relationship:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aries needs someone who is direct and up-front about things, as they don’t like to be waiting around on people.  They crave spontaneity and are impatient, so be up-front with them, never hide things from them and you’ll do just fine.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Taurus appreciates a gentle lover.  They’re looking for a civilized being who has taste and tact.  Rude words and an uninviting edge will quickly turn them off.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini needs to have contact with their lover at least a little bit everyday.  Regardless of medium, communication is key to a lasting relationship with a Gemini.  Don’t be afraid to shoot a quick text over to them for no other reason than you’re thinking about them.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span

about your needs in a relationship:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aries needs someone who is direct and up-front about things, as they don’t

fine.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Taurus appreciates a gentle lover.  They’re looking for a civilized being who has taste and tact.  Rude

a little bit everyday.  Regardless of medium, communication is key to a lasting relationship with a Gemini.  Don’t be afraid to shoot a quick text over to them for no other reason than you’re thinking about them.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer’s needs revolve around protection.  They enjoy feeling that they themselves are protected by

confused as a negative emotion, when it actually means that you’re starting to live in the present moment.  Living outside of the narrative you have in your head regarding your life can be tough, but

much different than the picture being painted in your head.</span>\n\nStrive to align your thoughts, feelings and emotions with with who you truly are and the reality you create for yourself will be better than the one being thought up in your mind.\n\n**Realizing you are responsible for your life and happiness – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be scary having the sudden realization that you are the only person responsible for your well-being and happiness.  Scary, because if your life suddenly takes a turn for the worse, there’s no one to turn to but yourself.  However, this

yourself is the best way to reduce stress and feel less overwhelmed by all things you want to do.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus enjoys doing things smart and right, as the last thing they want is to come off as incompetent.  This can lead you to being anxious about time constraints and deadlines.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also tend to stress about personal conflicts, whether you hurt someone’s feelings or can’t find a resolution to a fight; trust your gut and go with your instincts, they’ll guide you in the right direction.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini dislikes people who are visibly dull or foolish.  Tiny things like grammar and conventional spelling errors grind your

Leo act the most crazy, turning the King of the Jungle into an insecure, mess of a person.  Leos, you just need to accept what is happening in your life, and let it be.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span

privacy.  Allow people to know your boundaries and needs so that a winning solution for everyone can be reached.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius hates stagnation, so you’re prone to absolutely hating traffic.  You don’t enjoy any activities where you have to be on your best behavior to please someone else.  Stress in your life derives mainly from

Aquarius often feels pressed for time as there’s simply not enough of it in the day.  They like having things their way and dislike those who try to pressure them into doing things.  If you slow down

private creature.  Any situations that leave you feeling vulnerable or exposed will be stressful.  Invasions of privacy or space can leave you feeling ill, as does a loud environment.  Be sure to find

Your Zodiac Sign Says About How You Express Anger","slug":"what-your-zodiac-sign-says-about-how-you-express-anger","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to express their disappointments, frustrations and anger in different ways.  Maybe you’re the type to sit in the corner and brood or maybe you’re the type to start yelling and causing a big scene.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is multi-faceted emotion and there are endless ways to express it.  But your Zodiac sign also has a lot to say about how you handle yourself when you’re feeling pissed off. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is each Zodiac sign’s way of expressing anger:</span>\n\n**Aries (March 21 – April 19) | Temper tantrums**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aries are notorious for being firecrackers, and when it comes to anger, they’re prone to sudden outbursts.  They don’t like to sugarcoat things for anyone, so if they’re upset with you, you’ll know about it.</span>\n\n**Taurus (April 20 – May 20) | Build up and explode**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus is a dangerous person to upset, as they won’t initially let you know that they’re mad at you.  They let their emotions simmer, subtly trying to give hints that you’ve upset them before letting all of their boiling anger come flowing out like an erupting volcano.</span>\n\n**Gemini (May 21 – June 20) | Verbal expression**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Geminis are so obsessed with talking, it should come as no surprise that their anger is unleashed via their sharp tongues.  They like to scream, shout and throw insults that cut to the very core of a person’s being.</span>\n\n**Cancer (June 21 – July 22) | Kind of all over the place**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer doesn’t openly express their anger until they’ve taken all that they can handle.  First they sulk, then they become passive-aggressive, and then they become reclusive.  If no one has taken the time to try and remedy this situation, they go from crying to intense outbursts of anger.</span>\n\n**Leo (July 23 – August 22) | RAAAWR!**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Leo is quite apt at expressing anger.  When they’re pissed off, they love to shout and yell while becoming an intense storm of anger and fury.  They swear like sailors and use vulgar language during their outbursts.</span>\n\n**Virgo (August 23 – September 22) | Brood and brood**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos don’t particularly enjoy letting their anger out, so what usually happens is they hold all of it in for as long as they can until something tiny lights their fuse, blowing them into orbit.  Their anger is usually never about something immediate that happened, but rather something that happened long ago.</span>\n\n**Libra (September 23 – October 22) | Seething behind the scenes**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras despise confrontation and hate showing their anger because they think it makes them less attractive.  They try not to let their angry emotions get to them, but sometimes they do and they will lose their cool.</span>\n\n**Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) | We are the fury**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to get the Scorpio fired up, but should you somehow achieve this feat, be prepared for a venomous wrath.  Scorpios are adept at destroying a person with verbal onslaughts and looks that could kill, and they’re not quick to forgive or forget what you’ve done.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) | One big ball of fire**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius has no fear of turning it up to 11.  If you piss them off they’ll get rid of you in a heartbeat.  Try to distract them from their anger, as they will often lose sight of why they were even upset in the first place.</span>\n\n**Capricorn (December 22 – January 19) | Destroy everything you touch**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Capricorn isn’t likely to express anger until their threshold has been reached.  Once it has been reached though, they’re likely to want to break something, like the spirit of the person who has wronged them or that lamp in the corner over there.  </span>\n\n**Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) | Let it go, let it gooo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Sagittarius has no chill, then the Aquarius has all of the chill.  When they’re upset they’ll simply disengage with everyone around them and go for a drive, or walk around for a bit until they’re not upset anymore.  If they can’t seem to let it go, they’ll eventually lose their temper and dump all of their negative emotions on you.</span>\n\n**Pisces (February 19 – March) | Up, down and all around**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces aren’t ones to typically get very angry, which makes it all the worse when they finally do.  However, the only person they ever seem to get upset with is themselves.  Their rage includes violent, self-destructive behaviors, often requiring a bit of healing after they’re done with an outburst.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to express their disappointments, frustrations and anger in different ways.  Maybe you’re the

strong and vivid imaginations, and generosity in relationships that are important to them.  They can be quick-tempered and critical, but are typically at ease when in company and social settings.  They’re usually quite intellectual and enjoy notable popularity.</span>\n\n**Ox – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ox is known for being stoic and strong.  They face adversity head on and inspire confidence in others.  They handle their responsibilities methodically and often garner respect because of it.  They can come off as arrogant at times because they defend their interests with extreme determination, but this same determination is admirable as it founded in a sense of duty.</span>\n\n**Tigers – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tiger is highly sensitive and often turns to its emotions, allowing it to love deeply.  The Tiger needs to find the balance between their need for love, their strong competitive spirit, and their desire to dominate.  They’re well-suited for leadership, as they courageously face any and all challenges.</span>\n\n**Rabbits / Hare – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rabbits are well-liked people because of their affectionate and courteous nature.  They dislike drama, preferring to stay out of it.  They focus mainly on pursuits that make them happy, and would never deliberately hurt anyone.  Despite their fun-loving nature, they are usually quiet and reserved.</span>\n\n**Dragons – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragons are vibrant with energy and demonstrate a great charismatic presence, which can often come off as boisterous and loud occasionally.  They’re very talented people due to their high intelligence.  They enjoy demanding situations that provide them with opportunity to use all of their energies and talents to succeed.</span>\n\n**Snakes – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snakes are known for their wisdom and ability for profound thought.  They’re also quite charming and romantic.  Despite this quality for love, they are often loners and prefer secrecy.  This leads many snakes to be less socially popular than their peers, but that’s ok because the snake prefers its own company.</span>\n\n**Horses – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horse people prefer independence and hard work, which is often revealed in their characteristic egotism.  They possess great verbal acuity and a high intellectual capacity, however, providing them with the opportunity to be quite popular.  They will commit to hard work and success as long as the work they are doing is not seen as beneath them.</span>\n\n**Sheep – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheep are charming and likable folks, even if they are reserved.  A sheep person possesses a love for nature, art, and culture, and often commands a great deal of creativity themselves.  They can be timid, but are generally self-confident.  They are most fulfilled when in a relationship that provides security.</span>\n\n**Monkeys – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent and energetic, the Monkey touts a magnetic personality that draws people in.  They are often viewed as eccentric due to their quick wit and easy talent for finding humor in every situation.  </span>\n\n**Roosters – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roosters are known for their inclination toward industry and hard work, as well as their ability to easily express their views.  They do not like to share the spotlight with others, as they view their own opinions, and their right to share them, as highly important.  They can be very true and loyal in relationships, and have potential for success in their careers due to their high standards.</span>\n\n**Dogs – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dog people are notorious for their honesty and loyalty in relationships.  When they choose to tackle a new pursuit, they give it their all, whether it be in their career or their hobbies.  Dogs have sharp tongues that feel the need to criticize often, partly due to the fact that they adhere strongly to principles of justice and fairness.</span>\n\n**Pigs – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pig people make wonderful companions because of their ability to be sincere, kind, and tolerant.  They use their intellect to set high goals and then achieve them.  They have great sense of humor and possess great wit.  Their desire for social harmony allows them to overlook the faults in people, but this is also their greatest vulnerability, as they expect others to do the

even realizing it.  Here are five negative thought patterns that you should probably get out of your life, and fast:</span>\n\n**Catastrophizing**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This happens when we perceive a tiny mistake or misfortune in our lives as being the one thing that will ultimately ruin </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for us.  Not only does this exaggeration not help us, it fosters anxiety, fear, stress and helplessness.  Don’t believe that the worst has happened before it’s happened.</span>\n\n**Generalizing**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that everyone, somewhere deep inside of them, knows that when they say ‘blanket’ statements that unfairly group individuals together without a second glance, that there’s some element of dishonesty in what they’re saying.  Stating that everything is either ‘this way’ or ‘that way’ is a poor way of viewing the world.  Don’t make it a habit.</span>\n\n**Personalizing**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as we would like to think that we are at the center of the universe, we are not.  The world does not belong to you just as much as it does not belong to me.  Always acknowledge that people will act the way they act because they’re sorting through issues of their own, and that it probably doesn’t have anything to do with you (don’t take things so personally).  </span>\n\n**Filtering**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filtering is something that we all do.  Shockingly, people only like to hear things that resonate positively with what they believe or understand.  Try to avoid only hearing what you want to hear.  Take the good with the bad, because if you only have one side of the picture, how you can fully understand it?  </span>\n\n**“Should”-ing**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constantly telling yourself that you </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have done this or </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have done that is bad for one’s

think you </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be doing something then make the effort to make it happen.  If it’s not worth doing, then don’t

hormone.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**[Richard Wiseman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpGoWPrTJho),** professor for the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of

bedrooms.”</span>\n\n**Take a hot shower before bedtime**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A nice hot shower before your bedtime helps you fall asleep due to the rapid change in body temperature,

in a variety of different designs, shapes and colors, and use a light adhesive to keep them in place.  They’re also quite festive, meaning you can bust them out for those nights when you need to get creative with a costume.</span>\n\n**Use some tape**\n\n![breast life

and the strips come with a guarantee of being able to hold cup sizes A through D.</span>\n\n**No wardrobe malfunctions**\n\n![double

400;\">This special, double-sided tape can be used when you want to wear something that lets the girls breathe, but you also don’t want to them to pop out unexpectedly.  Low-cut necklines and the gap that forms between shirt buttons can be solved by using this type of bra alternative.</span>\n\n**Sew in some cups**\n\n![Sew in

them smooth and shapely.</span>\n\n**Grab a swimsuit top**\n\n![swim

simply don’t like using tape.  Lined, full-coverage styles are perfect for this look.</span>\n\nhttp://mashable.com/2015/10/17/bra-alternatives/#4wH.INn4Eaq0\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span

/></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bra alternative provides all of the benefits of your standard bra, but with 100% more freedom.  Disposable stickers and tapes can lift and support while keeping them in place for hours, and the strips come with a guarantee of being able to hold cup sizes A through D.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>No wardrobe malfunctions</strong></p>\n\n<p><img

/></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This special, double-sided tape can be used when you want to wear something that lets the girls breathe, but you also don’t want to them to pop out unexpectedly.  Low-cut necklines and the gap that forms between shirt buttons can be solved by using this type of bra alternative.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sew in some cups</strong></p>\n\n<p><img

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you just want to ditch the bra for the day.  Stitching in these molded cups to a dress or a top are a great way to give you an extra bit of emphasis on your boobs while also keeping them smooth and shapely.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Grab a swimsuit top</strong></p>\n\n<p><img

on in their lives, so you usually don’t have to worry about them stressing over much.  They like to tell you their fears and it’s easy to tell when they’re scared.  Maybe they like to grab hold of you during new or stressful situations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem like you know your child like the back of your hand, they don’t always like to display their anxieties.  Sometimes they’ll keep their fears and anxieties hidden.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five signs to look for if you think your child might be anxious and not

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety has just as much of an effect on the mind as it does the body.  Some common symptoms in anxious children include nauseated stomachs, gastrointestinal problems, chest pains, headaches, and cheek biting to name a few on the long list.  If you’ve taken your child to medical professionals in search of an answer to their ailments, but have found nothing, it might be anxiety.</span>\n\n**They suddenly don’t like school**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child is suddenly disinterested in school and you’re struggling to even get them there without resistance, anxiety might be to blame.  If they’re consistently feigning sickness only to be completely fine not long after you’ve let them play hookey, anxiety might be to blame.  Look for signs of them being totally fine during the weekends, and symptoms showing up right when school is back in session.</span>\n\n**Anger**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While kids typically experience anger for a variety of different reasons, which can make identifying the sole cause difficult, it could be anxiety that is causing them to reach their boiling point quicker than usual.  If they’re coming home from school with their fuse already lit or bedtime starts becoming a huge hassle, anxiety might be at the root of the issue.  Be observant of when and why they are getting angry.</span>\n\n**They’re avoiding their normal activities**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they’re always trying to stay home instead of going to restaurants or to stores or they’re avoiding activities and situations that they’ve enjoyed in the past, take some time to look into why.  It’s possible that they’ve simply moved on from certain things, but remember that the most common method of coping with anxiety in children is ‘avoidance’.  </span>\n\n**Routines and rituals**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child is practicing rituals or seeks out certain behaviors from others, like needing to be told “I love you” a certain way or a certain number of times before doing something, then they could be harboring anxiety.  While routines are often comforting and predictable, rituals need to be done to perfection, and need to be redone if they are not done correctly the first time.  Routines can be seen as healthy, while rituals are indicative of anxiety.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think your child might be anxious, the sooner they receive help for the better off they will be.  </span>\n\n(h/t

mean that your body is trying to tell you something.  The energy meridians of the body have been said to be connected to a clock system that stimulates different parts of the body at different times of the day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The time at which you find yourself waking up (or having trouble sleeping) can mean a variety of different things:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Between 9pm and 11pm**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you struggle to fall asleep during what is considered bedtime for most people it is a sign that you’re still carrying the stresses and anxieties of the day with you.  Meditation, positive mantras, and practicing relaxation techniques or exercises can help you fall asleep and stay asleep.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Between 11pm and

for Communicating Telepathically with Animals","slug":"5-tips-for-communicating-telepathically-with-animals","markdown":"\n<span class=\"s1\">While it might seem far-fetched at first, Dr. Linda Bender says that telepathy between yourself and animals is possible and she’ll help you do it.  In order to create the space in which one communicates telepathically with an animal, one must first quiet the mind, focus on living presently, and open the heart.  Once you’ve done this, practice doing one or more of the practices below for at least a few minutes a day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Animals mainly think in pictures and emotions.  So, when they’re trying to connect with you, they’ll often create a mental image or some type of emotion.  Communicating with animals isn’t like talking to a friend over the phone.  You will not ‘hear’ their words, necessarily, but rather different words will manifest in your own mind spontaneously as you receive their thoughts or feelings.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are five practices for telepathy with animals:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Pictorial Messages**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When trying to get your animal companion to do something for you, next time try forming a mental image of the action that you want them to do, and then focus on sending that image to them via ‘telepathic airwaves’.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Like in those old beer commercials, where the dog fetches a beer for his master out of the fridge, picture them doing whatever it is you want them to do.  You’ll start to notice that they respond to these mental messages.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Sending Feelings**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Similar to the last practice, you’ll be trying to send your emotions or feelings to your animal companion.  To try this, instead of exclaiming ‘good boy!’, practice focusing more on the actual feeling of being happy or satisfied with your companion.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Once you’ve really built up this emotion of being pleased inside of you, send it off to them.  Practicing this will help you both send and receive messages from animals.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Make a Metaphor**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Being able to create different metaphors is vital to understanding metaphors that you might receive from an animal.  Metaphors are mental images that symbolically represent certain feelings, emotions, or ideas.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, if I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, an image of Atlas holding the Earth on his shoulders might pop into my mind.  Practice creating different mental images of metaphors for the feelings you experience, as animals will often use these to try to speak to you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Send Comfort**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In the same way that you would send a mental image or a feeling, sending comfort is one of the best ways to get through to an animal telepathically.  Focus on the animal’s suffering and then brainstorm all of the ways you can offer it comfort.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You can send feelings of being loved or pictures of you soothing them or petting them.  If the animal is near death you might send them images of how happy they’ll be in their new afterlife animal sanctuary.  Gather these thoughts and feelings, prepare them to be sent and then shoot them over to the animal in need.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Requests for Help**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">While animals have no way of interpreting any sort of spoken message, they’re very apt at picking up on the emotions and feelings that lie behind them.  When a person asks for help, they typically expect a solution to be given in the form of a spoken answer, “you need to do this.”  Animals will not be able to answer questions like this.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Instead, focus on a current problem or concern that you have and then navigate your way through all of the different feelings and emotions that have motivated the question.  Use these feelings to build a statement instead of a question, acknowledge any images that come with it, and then telepathically send that statement (along with any emotions or pictures) to an animal, to yourself, to another person, or to your God.  </span>\n\n \n\n(h/t **[OM

Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.\n2. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\n**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this User Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.\n\n**Modification**. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this User Agreement, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check this User Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to this User Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n**Entire Agreement and Severability**. This User Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of this User Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this User Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder\n\n**Force Majeure**. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.\n\n**Assignment**. This User Agreement is personal to you, and is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.\n\n**Agency**. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this User Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.\n\n**Notices**. Unless otherwise specified in this User Agreement, all notices under this User Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.\n\n**No Waiver**. Our failure to enforce any part of this User Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of this User Agreement. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with this User Agreement to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.\n\n**Headings**. The section and paragraph headings in this User Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation.\n\n**Contact**.

Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.  \n2. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\n**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this User Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.\n\n**Modification**.

is What Happens to Your Body When You Put a Clothespin on Your Ear","slug":"clothespin-ear","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in control of one’s body is highly sought after by those who suffer from chronic aches, pains, mental illnesses, and other debilitating conditions.  It can be hard to acknowledge that your body is doing something you don’t want it to do, and the most stubborn of people will hold out, thinking they can fix whatever is wrong by using sheer willpower.  </span>\n\nWhile simply wishing something away will likely not work, there are **[alternatives](http://www.littlethings.com/pain-relief-stretches/?&utm_source=LTcom)** to pharmaceuticals and modern medicine, some of which have been around for centuries.  One of these is the method of pinching a clothespin to various different spots on your ears.\n\nI know it sounds strange at first, the idea of your ear being able to affect other parts of your body, but as certified **[reflexologist Helen Chin Lui](http://healingplacemedfield.com/reflexology-what-is/reflexology-what-is-ear-reflexology/#axzz3n9Xwj1Mg?&utm_source=LTcom)** writes, “each ear contains a complete reflex map of the body, rich with nerve endings and multiple connectors to the central nervous system.”\n\nWhile this method should never take the place of professional medical advice, the ear reflexology method is worth a try, whether it’s done with just your fingers, or an actual clothespin.\n\n**Each one of these six points is connected to pain and soreness in a specific part of the body; applying pressure to each spot will help relieve pain and aches for that part of the body.**\n\n**Scroll through and see which points might work for you!**\n\n![ear](http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/05/ear-285x300.jpg)\n\nThe most upper part of your ear is directly connected to your back and shoulders; applying pressure to this spot for about a minute should help reduce built-up tension.  Practice several times a day to relieve back and shoulder pain.\n\nThe next spot down is connected to the body’s organs.  If you suffer from severe internal pain, see a doctor, but for minor internal discomfort, try your fingers or a clothespin on this spot.\n\nThe upper-middle portion of the ear is the most closely associated with pain and stiffness in the joints.  Pressure on this spot will provide relief in the jointed areas.  Chronic joint pain is worth going to a doctor for, but this method is worth a shot.\n\nThe fourth, lower-middle part of the ear is associated with the sinuses and throat.  Pressure here can help with relief from a cold or sinus infection and throat soreness.\n\nThe fifth position, just above the lobe, is connected to the digestive processes of the body.  A clothespin here will help relieve digestive issues and minor stomach problems.  This method can be done in advance as a preventative measure.\n\nThe lowest point on the ear, the lobe, is connected to the two most important parts of our body: the head and the heart.  Pressure on this spot will promote a healthy heart and can relieve unwanted pressure in the head.  It is great for relieving pressure headaches.\n\nGive them a try!\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in control of one’s body is

there are <strong><a href=\"http://www.littlethings.com/pain-relief-stretches/?&amp;utm_source=LTcom\">alternatives</a></strong> to pharmaceuticals and modern medicine, some of which have been around for centuries.  One of these is the method of pinching a clothespin to various different spots on your ears.</p>\n\n<p>I know it sounds strange at first, the idea of your ear being able to affect other parts of your body, but as certified <strong><a href=\"http://healingplacemedfield.com/reflexology-what-is/reflexology-what-is-ear-reflexology/#axzz3n9Xwj1Mg?&amp;utm_source=LTcom\">reflexologist Helen Chin Lui</a></strong> writes, “each ear contains a complete reflex map of the body, rich with nerve endings and multiple connectors to the central nervous system.”</p>\n\n<p>While this method should never take the place of professional medical advice, the ear reflexology method is worth a try, whether it’s done with just your fingers, or an actual clothespin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Each one of these six points is connected to pain and soreness in a specific part of the body; applying pressure to each spot will help relieve pain and aches for that part of the body.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Scroll through and see which points might work for you!</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/05/ear-285x300.jpg\" alt=\"ear\" /></p>\n\n<p>The most upper part of your ear is directly connected to your back and shoulders; applying pressure to this spot for about a minute should help reduce built-up tension.  Practice several times a day to relieve back and shoulder pain.</p>\n\n<p>The next spot down is connected to the body’s organs.  If you suffer from severe internal pain, see a doctor, but for minor internal discomfort, try your fingers or a clothespin on this spot.</p>\n\n<p>The upper-middle portion of the ear is the most closely associated with pain and stiffness in the joints.  Pressure on this spot will provide relief in the jointed areas.  Chronic joint pain is worth going to a doctor for, but this method is worth a shot.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth, lower-middle part of the ear is associated with the sinuses and throat.  Pressure here can help with relief from a cold or sinus infection and throat soreness.</p>\n\n<p>The fifth position, just above the lobe, is connected to the digestive processes of the body.  A clothespin here will help relieve digestive issues and minor stomach problems.  This method can be done in advance as a preventative measure.</p>\n\n<p>The lowest point on the ear, the lobe, is connected to the two most important parts of our body: the head and the heart.  Pressure on this spot will promote a healthy heart and can relieve unwanted pressure in the head.  It is great for relieving pressure headaches.</p>\n\n<p>Give them a try!</p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/05/feature_imageear_template.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-05-05

a dog owner then you know just how rewarding it can be.  Dogs are known as “man’s best friend” for a reason, because they’ve been our trusted sidekicks for as long as we can remember.  And as it turns out, all of the time that we’ve spent together over the centuries has led to dogs developing unique and subtle ways of expressing their love for us.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we might not be able to communicate with them like Doctor Dolittle, we will at least know when they’re feeling loved and want to give some love back.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ways that they express their love are not always obvious, but we’ll discuss at least five different practices they like to do to show their human companions love and support:</span>\n\n**Staring

well-known dog expert, Brian Hare, when dogs look you in the eye, they’re actually “hugging you with [their] eyes.”  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you and your buddy are playing together or having a nice cuddle session, the same hormone that helps mothers and babies bond, oxytocin, is released in the dog’s brain.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try keeping eye consistent eye contact with them as you go about your normal daily routine with them, but do not actively stare them down, as it will only make them feel uncomfortable.</span>\n\n**Sharing yawns**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that yawning is one of the most contagious things in the world, but what you might not have known is that it’s not limited to humans.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogs have been bred by humans to understand humans, so when you yawn, your doggy companion will likely reciprocate the gesture.</span>\n\n**Leaning on

for a reason, because they’ve been our trusted sidekicks for as long as we can remember.  And as it turns out, all of the time that we’ve spent together over the centuries has led to dogs developing unique and subtle ways of expressing their love for us.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we might not be able to communicate with them like Doctor Dolittle, we will at least know when they’re feeling loved and want to give some love back.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ways that they express their love are not always obvious, but we’ll discuss at least five different practices they like to do to show their human companions love and support:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Staring straight into your eyes</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60 Minutes </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">segment featuring well-known dog expert, Brian Hare, when dogs look you in the eye, they’re actually “hugging you with [their] eyes.”  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you and your buddy are playing together or having a nice cuddle session, the same hormone that helps mothers and babies bond, oxytocin, is released in the dog’s brain.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try keeping eye consistent eye contact with them as you go about your normal daily routine with them, but do not actively stare them down, as it will only make them feel uncomfortable.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sharing yawns</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that yawning is one of the most contagious things in the world, but what you might not have known is that it’s not limited to humans.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogs have been bred by humans to understand humans, so when you yawn, your doggy companion will likely reciprocate the gesture.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leaning on you</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogs like to lean on their companions for a variety of reasons, like anxiety or wanting you to do something or take them somewhere, but it is also used to express affection. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if anxiety is the sole reason they’re leaning on you, they’re doing this because they recognize you as a source of protection and safety.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sleeping in your room</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take note of where your buddy likes to sleep.  If your dog likes to catch

when not to do something.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all signs that your psychic ability is in good health.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four most

eyes and try to picture how your body appears as it is now.  For example, I’m sitting on my couch.  I’d try to think to think about as much detail as I could about how I exist right now.

yourself, the more clairvoyant you are said to be.</span>\n\n**To test your ‘clairaudience’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your eyes again, but this time focus solely on all of the different noises and sounds that fill the air around you.  Then, slowly work to eliminate each sound from your head until you find the silence that lies underneath all of the sound.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found this low, universal vibration, listen to your heart beating and the sound of your lungs working.  This can take days to achieve, but if you can, then you are likely clairaudient.</span>\n\n**To test ‘clairsentience’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This test requires that you take a photograph of a person that you do not personally know, but whom someone close to you knows.  Practice analyzing all of the different feelings and emotions you get when you look at the picture of this person.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel like you can trust them?  What kind of person do you think they are?  Good or bad, write down your thoughts and then discuss them with your friend.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that your predictions or thoughts about the person were accurate or significant, you are probably clairsentient.</span>\n\n**To test ‘claircognizance’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This exercise requires you to look inward, asking for guidance and direction from your higher being.  Once you’ve asked for this guidance, start by writing down a question onto the piece of paper.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then start jotting down whatever thoughts begin flowing through your mind.  Simply write down the words as they come to you; try not to think about what the words or thoughts mean, simply let your thoughts flow and write them down as they come.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you remain consistent with this exercise, your claircognizant ability will eventually become quite prominent, and if you begin to receive messages that are specific or that seem important to you at that time, then you’re likely very claircognizant.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of us possess some level of psychic ability, whether we’re aware of it or not.  Maybe you’ve noticed

working.  This can take days to achieve, but if you can, then you are likely clairaudient.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To test ‘clairsentience’</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This test requires that you take a photograph of a person that you do not personally know, but whom someone close to you knows.  Practice analyzing all of the different feelings and emotions you get when you look at the picture of this person.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel like you can trust them?  What kind of person do you think they are?  Good or bad, write down your thoughts and then discuss them with your friend.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that your predictions or thoughts about the person were accurate or significant, you are probably clairsentient.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To test ‘claircognizance’</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This exercise requires you to look inward, asking for guidance and direction from your higher being.  Once you’ve asked for this guidance, start by writing down a question onto the piece of paper.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then start jotting down whatever thoughts begin flowing through your mind.  Simply write down the words as they come to you; try not to think about what the words or thoughts mean, simply let your thoughts flow and write them down as they come.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you remain consistent with this exercise, your claircognizant ability will eventually become quite prominent, and if you begin to receive messages that are specific or that seem important to you at that time, then you’re likely very claircognizant.</span></p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/05/feature_image_tecvcvmplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-05-16

Stages of Love & Why Everyone Stops at Stage 3","slug":"the-5-stages-of-love-why-everyone-stops-at-stage-3","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is one of the most highly sought after things in the world, so much so that people often act crazy or entirely unlike themselves when they’ve fallen for someone.  People of all ages want to find love, yet we see an astonishing number of relationships and marriages that fall apart over time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the five stages of love and why most people end up calling it quits after stage three:</span>\n\n**Stage 1 – Falling in love**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never fallen in love before, give it a shot sometime.  It’s one of the craziest experiences that you’ll ever forget.  Falling in love is great for many reasons, but mostly because our brains get flooded with chemicals that are designed to make us feel amazing.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen are all swirling together to give us butterflies.  When you’re in love, no one call to you otherwise, because you’re 100% certain of the way you’re feeling.</span>\n\n**Stage 2 – Coming together as a couple**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During stage two, the love between two individuals becomes deeper and a little more mature.  This is the stage when most people want to have children and rear them together, as their bond becomes strengthened.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The individuals start making decisions based around the couple, rather than the individual.  Most people feel that this is the love that will last a lifetime, and they are often the same people that are so taken aback by stage three.</span>\n\n**Stage 3 – Becoming disillusioned**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage three often throws people for a loop because this is the time when one or both people start feeling uncertain about the direction that their relationship is headed.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage three is when things start to feel wrong.  You become resentful and angry over the littlest things, you feel less loved and intimate, and you want out.  You want to bring back that spark or chemistry, but you’re unsure of how to do it.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting through stage three can be very difficult, but if the couple can survive it, they’ll come out on the other side stronger and more in love than ever.</span>\n\n**Stage 4 – Building a real, lasting love**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can make it through stage three, then stage four is your reward.  Stage four takes place after you’ve gotten to the core of all the pain and conflict and are now working to resolve it.  And part of resolving your issues is understanding that everyone is wounded on some level, and that these wounds play a large role in your relationships.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, ongoing research by The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study has shown that childhood trauma can affect our physical, emotional, and relational health in profound ways.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a lasting love means wanting to grow and help each other heal your wounds.  Once the two of you start to heal, you’ll notice the chemistry and feelings of true love start to flourish again.</span>\n\n**Stage 5 – Using your love to take on the world**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is often seen as a pretty terrible place and for the most part, it is.  Thinking about the endless amount of conflict and turmoil that plagues every region of the planet can be disheartening; it makes us feel like there’s really nothing we can do individually to help out.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a lasting love between just two people is incredibly hard as it is, how can we do that with 7 billion people?  But maybe finding true love and then building a lasting love is the first step in this process.  If we can do this, then maybe we can start looking outward, seeking ways to help the world come together in love.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is one of the most highly sought after things in the world, so

abuse is the last thing on our mind.  Because we don’t expect this person, who has committed his or herself to a relationship, to want to damage it in any way.  But, for whatever reasons, we still find ourselves in both emotionally and physically abusive relationships.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike physical abuse, which leaves its mark on the body for all to see, emotional abuse wounds us in more profound ways, ways that often go unnoticed.  And it’s just as easy to be the abuser as it is to be the abused.  Recognizing emotionally abusive habits are key to stopping them altogether.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five signs that emotional abuse is taking place:</span>\n\n**Being publicly shamed**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general,

you can do or change to make them happy, leading to a degenerated sense of self-worth.</span>\n\n**Using jokes to mask insults**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like most people have a friend or know someone who uses jokes and half-truths to subtly insult or demean others.  Being able to laugh at yourself is a good trait to have, but allowing someone to degrade you in a way that seems affable is not okay.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes they don’t even realize they’re doing it, however, that does not make it acceptable behavior.</span>\n\n**Seeking retribution**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone makes mistakes and messes up every now and then, it’s part of being human.  So, actively seeking a form of ‘revenge’ for something that your

your partner always takes the time to belittle you and make you feel inferior to them, you should probably move on.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These people love to remind you just

No Idea THIS is What the Extra Shoelace Hole Was For...Good To Know!","slug":"i-had-no-idea-this-is-what-the-extra-shoelace-hole-was-for-good-to-know","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up, every time I got a new pair of shoes, I noticed that there was always an extra top shoelace hole that rests behind that one that you actually use.  “Why would anyone want to lace their shoes all the way up here?” I always wondered.  Well, it turns out that that hole actually serves a function.  Yeah, it’s not simply another hole for you to get creative with your lacing.</span>\n\nYou’ll find that almost all running and hiking shoes have this extra mystery shoelace hole, and the video below will show you exactly how to utilize it.  They’re typically used to prevent blisters on your heels by stopping your foot from getting jammed at the toe.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IijQyX_YCKA?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tying your laces with this “heel lock” or “lace lock” method creates friction between the laces at the top of the shoe, closest to the ankle.  What this effectively does is tighten the heel/ankle area without you having to re-tighten the entire shoe.  </span>\n\nTo achieve this lacing technique, begin by inserting the lace in backwards through the top hole so that you have a small loop on either side of your shoe.  Then, cross your laces and insert them each into the loop on the opposite side and tighten them.  Remember to go down and not up, as cinching upward leaves the loop hanging out of the shoe, which you do not want.  Pulling downward creates that

I noticed that there was always an extra top shoelace hole that rests behind that one that you actually use.  “Why would anyone want to lace their shoes all the way up here?” I always wondered.  Well, it turns out that that hole actually serves a function.  Yeah, it’s not simply another hole for you to get creative with your lacing.</span></p>\n\n<p>You’ll find that almost all running and hiking shoes have this extra mystery shoelace hole, and the video below will show you exactly how to utilize it.  They’re typically used to prevent blisters on your heels by stopping your foot from getting jammed at the toe.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IijQyX_YCKA?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tying your laces with this “heel lock” or “lace lock” method creates friction between the laces at the top of the shoe, closest to the ankle.  What this effectively does is tighten the heel/ankle area without you having to re-tighten the entire shoe.  </span></p>\n\n<p>To achieve this lacing technique, begin by inserting the lace in backwards through the top hole so that you have a small loop on either side of your shoe.  Then, cross your laces and insert them each into the loop on the opposite side and tighten them.  Remember to go down and not up, as cinching upward leaves the loop hanging out of the shoe, which you do not want.  Pulling downward creates that tight, locking feel that we want.  Finish by tying your shoe as your normally would and then you’re off!</p>\n\n<p>h/t <strong><a href=\"http://www.sun-gazing.com/extra-shoelace-hole-used-wish-knew-earlier/\">Sun

Old-Fashioned Relationship Habits We Should Practice Today","slug":"5-old-fashioned-relationship-habits-we-should-practice-today","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not every day that you see small romantic gestures take place.  An old man walking around to the other side of the car to open the door for his wife or pulling out a chair at the dinner table for her to sit down.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is different nowadays.  And while that’s not a bad thing, the love of today could use a bit of old-fashioned inspiration.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five old-fashioned relationship habits we should bring back:</span>\n\n**Spending quality time with one another without technology or any major plans**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the best moments we have with our partners are the ones that are spent doing absolutely nothing together.  The next time you’re with your partner try to avoid using any laptops or phones and do something simple, like going for a walk or having a fun conversation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have to make big plans to be together–just make sure that you’re spending time together as often as possible, face to face.</span>\n\n**Being fully present and available in the moment**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever started telling a story only to find that no one is listening to you just seconds into it?  It’s not a good feeling.  One of the best ways to show your partner that you care about them is by being fully attentive and focused on what they’re saying to you.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your partners, friends, and family members will always remember how you made them feel by giving them the time of day.</span>\n\n**A focus on inner beauty**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a funny thing, when you really get to know someone, on a deeper level than usual, their physical characteristics start to fade away when you look at them.  Their outward appearance is no longer important, as you’re focused on their energy, their scent, their intelligence.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why none of us are really capable of falling in love with physical attributes.</span>\n\n**Apologizing at the right times**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being proud is a good trait to have, to an extent.  But never let your pride cloud your judgment.  If you’ve wronged someone and know that you’ve hurt them, apologize and seek out forgiveness.

and beyond for their friends, family members and partners.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not every day that you see small romantic gestures take place.  An old man walking around to the other side of the car to open the door for his wife or pulling out a chair at the dinner table for her to sit down.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is different nowadays.  And while that’s not a bad thing, the love of today could use a bit of old-fashioned inspiration.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five old-fashioned relationship habits we should bring back:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Spending quality time with one another without technology or any major plans</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the best moments we have with our partners are the ones that are spent doing absolutely nothing together.  The next time you’re with your partner try to avoid using any laptops or phones and do something simple, like going for a walk or having a fun conversation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have to make big plans to be together–just make sure that you’re spending time together as often as possible, face to face.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Being fully present and available in the moment</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever started telling a story only to find that no one is listening to you just seconds into it?  It’s not a good feeling.  One of the best ways to show your partner that you care about them is by being fully attentive and focused on what they’re saying to you.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your partners, friends, and family members will always remember how you made them feel by giving them the time of day.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>A focus on inner beauty</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a funny thing, when you really get to know someone, on a deeper level than usual, their physical characteristics start to fade away when you look at them.  Their outward appearance is no longer important, as you’re focused on their energy, their scent, their intelligence.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why none of us are really capable of falling in love with physical attributes.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Apologizing at the right times</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being proud is a good trait to have, to an extent.  But never let your pride cloud your judgment.  If you’ve wronged someone and know that you’ve hurt them, apologize and seek out forgiveness.  Relationships that last a lifetime don’t do so by being stubborn.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say you’re sorry and mean it.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Be loyal and never break promises</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A trait that I’ve always admired in people is their ability to commit to things.  Those people that stand by their word and speak with meaning.  They follow through on their promises, sometimes even over-delivering, doing more than what’s required simply because they know it matters.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be one of those people who goes above and beyond for their

lives for numerous different reasons, and they’re not strictly romantic.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These spiritual partners find their way into your life at just the right time, helping you overcome certain obstacles or helping you reach certain realizations, so that you may continue forward on your life journey.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the four different kinds of soul mates that you should keep an eye out for:</span>\n\n**Soul mates that heal**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healing soul mates are those that come into your life with

of old patterns or when you are struggling with issues from the past.</span>\n\n**Soul mates from past lives**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are people that you instantly connect with due to your relationship in a past life.  These relationships feel as though they will last through eternity, and they likely will, because you never feel the need to hide anything from them.  These relationships shape us, helping us grow into the people we’re meant to be.</span>\n\n**To recognize one**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These people show up when you’re busy just being yourself–carefree and doing your thing.  They only want the best for you and want to help you achieve your goals.  </span>\n\n**Karmic soul mates**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmic soul mates are linked to you through a past life as well.  Deep and karmic, these relationships can be painful because they’re largely focused on struggles of the ego.  But this pain is expected to be endured, as that is the point of the relationship.  The goal is to learn how to overcome suffering.</span>\n\n**To recognize one**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These soul mates have usually been reincarnated, so as to relive specific karma that will help break a negative cycle.  Because of this, you will often share an almost twin-like connection, feeling what they feel during times of extreme or intense emotion.</span>\n\n**The Twin Flames**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve found a person that you can talk to for hours, who thinks just like you do, who you do everything with, you might have found your twin flame.  Meeting your twin flame makes you feel good, as your relationship exudes wholeness.  These may or may not be romantic partners; either way, the relationship will last a lifetime and completely transcends ego.</span>\n\n**To recognize one**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This person feels entirely comfortable to you, as if you’ve known

Red Flags That You’re Dealing With a Manipulative Person","slug":"10-red-flags-that-youre-dealing-with-a-manipulative-person","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychopaths can be hard to spot at times because they carry themselves in a way that mimics a normal person.  They’re often very charismatic, altruistic and sincere at first, but then turn into nightmares when they’re not getting what they want from you or when you are no longer of use to them.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly when it comes to relationships, psychopaths are often in rare form; it’s where they thrive.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are ten signs that you’ve become involved with a manipulative person:</span>\n\n**You’re uncomfortable being around them, but still care about them liking you**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re constantly brushing off their not-so-kind behavior, seeing it as accidental or playful, just so you can keep their attention and praise, you’re probably dealing with a psychopath.  They don’t really care if you take off or ignore them, they’ll just move on to the next person.</span>\n\n**They give attention and praise only so they can take it away later**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manipulators love to shower a person with affection and attention, making them feel as though it is genuine and sincere, only to suddenly become reclusive and unresponsive later.  They make you rely on this attention, so that you crave it when you’re no longer getting it.</span>\n\n**They tell you that you’re their soul mate almost instantly**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, sometimes when you know, you know.

Depression","slug":"stephen-hawking-has-a-beautiful-message-for-anyone-suffering-from-depression","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have heard about a man by the name of **[Stephen Hawking](http://www.biography.com/people/stephen-hawking-9331710)**, whether it be in the media or in your social circles, because he is one of the greatest minds of our time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the age of 21, Hawking started developing symptoms of ALS, or**[amyotrphic lateral sclerosis](http://www.alsa.org/about-als/what-is-als.html?referrer=https://www.bing.com/),** a disease that doctors claimed would take his life in about two and a half years.  Now 74, Hawking is a huge inspiration for those with disabilities, as he continues to teach, research, and provide profound wisdoms for the rest of us to ponder.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his diagnosis, Hawking says that he had absolutely no expectations for life.  But he didn’t let it deter him from doing his best to live fully and passionately.  **[He has twelve honorary degrees](http://www.biography.com/people/stephen-hawking-9331710)** and has built a life dedicated to the study of theoretical physics, including robust theories on creation, the Big Bang and the universe.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression is a subject that Hawking recently commented on at a lecture in London at the Royal Institute, likening the condition to a black hole:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The message of this lecture is that black holes ain’t as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don’t give up; there’s a way out”</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_d7O9JGo_s?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, when asked about his disabilities and the effect they have on his outlook on life, he responded beautifully:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. </span>**However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While there’s life, there is hope.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would further this sentiment with a heartfelt message for those with disabilities like himself:</span>\n\n**“If you are disabled, it is probably not your fault, but it is no good blaming the world or expecting it to take pity on you.**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One has to have a positive attitude and must make the best of the situation that one finds oneself in; if one is physically disabled, one cannot afford to be psychologically disabled as well. In my opinion, one should concentrate on activities in which one’s physical disability will not present a serious handicap. I am afraid that Olympic Games for the disabled do not appeal to me, but it is easy for me to say that because I never liked athletics anyway. On the other hand, science is a very good area for disabled people because it goes on mainly in the mind. Of course, most kinds of experimental work are probably ruled out for most such people, but theoretical work is almost ideal.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My disabilities have not been a significant handicap in my field, which is theoretical physics.

They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don’t give up; there’s a way out”</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_d7O9JGo_s?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, when asked about his disabilities and the effect they have on his outlook on life, he responded beautifully:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. </span><strong>However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While there’s life, there is hope.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would further this sentiment with a heartfelt message for those with disabilities like himself:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>“If you are disabled, it is probably not your fault, but it is no good blaming the world or expecting it to take pity on you.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One has to have a positive attitude and must make the best of the situation that one finds oneself in; if one is physically disabled, one cannot afford to be psychologically disabled as well. In my opinion, one should concentrate on activities in which one’s physical disability will not present a serious handicap. I am afraid that Olympic Games for the disabled do not appeal to me, but it is easy for me to say that because I never liked athletics anyway. On the other hand, science is a very good area for disabled people because it goes on mainly in the mind. Of course, most kinds of experimental work are probably ruled out for most such people, but theoretical work is almost ideal.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My disabilities have not been a significant handicap in my field, which is theoretical physics. Indeed, they have helped me in a way by shielding me from lecturing and administrative work that I would otherwise have been involved in. I have managed, however, only because of the large amount of help I have received from my wife, children, colleagues and students. I find that people in general are very ready to help, but you should encourage them to feel that their efforts to aid you are worthwhile by doing as well as you possibly can.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch Stephen Hawking’s lecture on how to escape a black hole in the video above and remember, “while there’s life, there’s hope.”</span></p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/06/feature_imazsd4ws4ge_template.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-06-05 04:24:51","created_by":3,"updated_at":"2016-06-05 04:24:51","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-06-05 04:24:51","published_by":3},{"id":125,"uuid":"9c10930a-6f67-46f0-9f9f-dd02d87b3578","title":"How Colorful Is Your World?

Because of that, their sleep need is greater. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A man who has a complex job that involves a lot of decision-making and lateral thinking may also need more sleep than the average male — though probably still not as much as a woman.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whether you’re shaking your head in disbelief, or nodding your head in agreement (as you’ve known for years that women’s brains are highly complex and nearly impossible to figure out) it would appear that women do, on average, need about 20 more minutes of sleep than men.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is because women’s brains are wired differently from men’s and are more complex, so their sleep need will be slightly greater. The average is 20 minutes more, but some women may need slightly more or less than this.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, however, another study looking at 210 middle-aged men and women discovered that **[women suffered greater health issues from lack of sleep than men did](http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/issues/050608/depgaz15.html).**</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We found that for women, poor sleep is strongly associated with high levels of psychological distress and greater feelings of hostility, depression, and anger. In contrast, these feelings were not associated with the same degree of sleep disruption in men.”</span>\n\nSo guys, if you want a happy, healthy girlfriend or wife, make sure they’re getting the sleep they need to keep those high-functioning, complex brains of theirs well rested.\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting to sleep in is one of the greatest joys in this world.  Waking up, knowing that you can start your day whenever you please is an indulgence that I take as often as I can, and I actually get to do it fairly often.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My girlfriend on the other hand, not so much.  Her new job requires her to be up and alert in the early hours of the morning, and science is saying that<strong><a href=\"http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/issues/050608/depgaz15.html\">she should be the one sleeping in, not me</a></strong>.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, women need 20 minutes more shut-eye than the average man.” writes study authors. “And that’s down to a woman’s busy, multi-tasking brain.” </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1246029/Who-REALLY-needs-sleep--men-women-One-Britains-leading-sleep-experts-says-answer.html\">Professor Jim Horne</a></strong>, director of the Sleep Research Center at Loughborough University and author of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleepfaring: A Journey Through The Science of Sleep</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need.

your life will ease these pains.</span>\n\n**Pain in the head**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headaches are associated with the inability to make a decision.  And migraines, being the older

pains**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain in the neck is linked to forgiveness, whether it be forgiving others or yourself.  Reflect on the things you love about yourself as well as the things you love about those around you; this will help you become more aware and more capable of letting go.</span>\n\n**Gum pain**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to neck pain, gum pain is tied to inaction regarding decision-making.  Be assertive, be confident and make choices with purpose.</span>\n\n**Stomach pain**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain in our stomachs are related to a lack of feeling whole or fulfilled in life.  It is the result of a void within ourselves, one that leaves us in pain.</span>\n\n**Lower back pain**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress caused by anxiety over finances or even just a general lack of emotional support can cause pain in the lower back.  This could be a sign that it’s time you ask for a raise or work to manage your money more efficiently.</span>\n\n**Pain in the elbows**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elbow pain is correlated with resistance to any change that may be happening in your life.  Stiffness is indicative

this burden and decide whether or not you need to keep carrying it.</span>\n\n**Hand pain**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hand pain is associated with how often you’re reaching out to others.  If you’re experiencing hand pain, attempt to make new friends or reconnect with an old one.  Make plans with your coworkers or neighbors.  Build new connections.</span>\n\n**Pain in the teeth**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teeth pains are connected to consistent negative thought patterns, ones that repeat how much you dislike your current situation.  If you practice positive

life gives you lemons..’ being said when times are tough.  But it takes on a whole new meaning after you learn how to grow your own lemon tree, because now when life gives you lemons, you simply plant and grow more lemons!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your own lemon tree is easy and highly rewarding, making it a fun little side project if you’re looking for something to do or simply want a steady supply of lemons.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon trees grow their very hardest when they’re outdoors, year-round, in a hot and sunny climate.  However, they can be grown inside during seasons with cold or not ideal climates.</span>\n\n**To start growing your lemon tree – Procure the following items**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An organic lemon since non-organic lemons often contain non-germinating seeds</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertile potting soil, preferably containing peat, vermiculite, perlite, and natural fertilizers</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A planting pot that is six inches wide and six inches deep (will be used for sprouting)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seedling pot that is about 24 inches wide by 12 inches deep</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sunny, indoor growing location and possibly a grow light</span>\n\n**Use these steps to grow your lemon tree**\n\n1. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisten the potting soil so that it is damp, but not soaked, all the way through.</span>\n2. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the smaller pot with soil, all the way up to an inch below the rim.</span>\n3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut open your lemon and remove a seed. Remove all of the pulp from its surface. A good way to do this is to simply suck on it until it is clean.</span>\n4. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not delay to plant. The seed must still be moist when it is buried into the soil. Plant the seed about half an inch deep in the middle of the pot.</span>\n5. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spray the soil that is directly above the seed gently with water from a spray bottle.</span>\n6. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap, seal the edges with a good rubber band, and poke small holes in the top with a pencil.</span>\n7. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place the pot in a warm, sunny location.</span>\n8. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spray on more water occasionally, not allowing the soil to dry out. Do not cause water to puddle though. Just keep the soil somewhat moist.</span>\n9. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After about two weeks, when the sproutling emerges, take the plastic covering off. If you need additional light for your lemon plant, you can use a grow light to supplement the sun’s light.</span>\n10. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take care of the young plant by keeping the soil damp, by making sure it gets at least eight full hours of light per day, and by giving it moderate doses of organic fertilizer.</span>\n11. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch over your plant to ensure it is not attacked by bugs or diseases. Prune off brown, dead leaves when necessary. Use pesticides if you must. Protect your new lemon tree!</span>\n12. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the plant outgrows its small pot, put it in the larger pot. You will go through much the same procedure when you re-plant it as when you first planted. Younger plants need more water than older plants, but they all do need adequate water. Don’t starve your poor plant after all that work of growing it!</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/57XoFG0QuMI?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it cheaper to grow your own lemons, but you gain real experience growing plant life, making it valuable as well as educational.  Not to mention, you pretty much have fresh lemons whenever you want them and the lemon tree is a stylish piece of home decor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, take on a new summer project and see if you can grow your own lemon tree.  And be sure to share this fun idea with someone who loves fresh lemons and growing fruit!</span>\n\nh/t [**EcoSnippet**](http://www.ecosnippets.com/gardening/grow-lemons-from-seed/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You always hear the phrase ‘when life gives you lemons..’ being said when times are tough.  But it takes on a whole new meaning after you learn how to grow your own lemon tree, because now when life gives you lemons, you simply plant and grow more lemons!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your own lemon tree is easy and highly rewarding, making it a fun little side project if you’re looking for something to do or simply want a steady supply of lemons.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon trees grow their very hardest when they’re outdoors, year-round, in a hot and sunny climate.  However, they can be grown inside during seasons with cold or not ideal climates.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To start growing your lemon tree – Procure the following items</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An organic lemon since non-organic lemons often contain non-germinating seeds</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertile potting soil, preferably containing peat, vermiculite, perlite, and natural fertilizers</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A planting pot that is six inches wide and six inches deep (will be used for sprouting)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seedling pot that is about 24 inches wide by 12 inches deep</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sunny, indoor growing location and possibly a grow light</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Use these steps to grow your lemon tree</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisten the potting soil so that it is damp, but not soaked, all the way through.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the smaller pot with soil, all the way up to an inch below the rim.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut open your lemon and remove a seed.

this sounds like you, you could be an empath.  As one, you’re prone to absorbing the energies and feelings of those around you, which can be both good </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bad.  Good, because being around positive people allows you to soak up positive energy, and bad for the same reason.  If you have any toxic or negative people

the crab, and with good reason.  When they’re feeling vulnerable or insecure, Cancers enjoy the security and protection that retreating into their “shell” provides.  Don’t let their shell fool you though, as they are natural born leaders; they simply like to lead in quieter ways than others.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 7 traits of the Cancer:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a water sign, they possess imagination and creativity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inherently psychic and highly intuitive</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have a hard time letting go of the past and are known for holding on</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A high

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong sense of empathy and ability to feel for others</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likes to focus on the care, comfort and protection of their

Sign","slug":"dealing-with-heartbreak-using-your-zodiac-sign","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re going through a tough time and have had to separate from your partner recently, you might be left feeling lost and confused.  Heartbreak affects everyone differently, and your zodiac sign has a lot to do with that.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a bit of insight as to how each sign handles the pain of heartbreak, so that you might grow a little easier:</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting close to people is difficult for you, so when you do fall, you fall hard; which makes breaking up that much harder.  You’re not one to outwardly express the pain you’re feeling because you don’t like feeling vulnerable, so you stay busy and speak only to those who are close to you.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re likely to fully embrace the sadness and sorrow accompanied with most breakups, but you do so because you are not worried about being vulnerable or showing ‘weakness.’  You know that to fully heal you must finish your grieving.</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Aries gets hurt, they tend to look to their friends for support because of how social and outgoing they are.  Aries like to stay busy when they’re hurting; this lets them cover their pain with work and activities, pretending as if it hasn’t phased them.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus struggles at times to adequately express how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking.  You’re quick to be set off as you occasionally let your emotions flare up, but you have only kindness in your heart, and want someone who loves as deeply as you do.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemini tend to live in the moment, so a failed relationship or parting of ways is simply water under the bridge.  They like to focus on what’s happening </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead of what happened yesterday.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancers fall back on their career or work during times of emotional duress because they are natural leaders and enjoy working.  You like to hide your sensitive side, not letting your personal life and work life intersect.  And your friends are always the focus after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos are traditionally both loyal and faithful people, enjoying passionate relationships with their partners.  Because of this, they are often shocked when their partner wishes to separate.  Leos will undoubtedly be hurt, but are also very understanding, wishing their partners the best as they move in a different direction.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos struggle to commit to one person, meaning they take breakups pretty hard.  But that doesn’t mean they’ll stay down for long.  They’re usually the first ones to be back in the dating scene, doing their best to move on–which they will.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The usually optimistic and upbeat Libra doesn’t stay hurt for long.  You might even be willing to stay friends with your former partner.  You will most likely spend most of your time with friends and family after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios are quick to become reclusive, wanting to deal with their emotions by themselves.  They don’t like others seeing how hurt they are, so they simply pretend that they’re not.  You’ll likely try to stay busy to avoid thinking about it.  Scorpios are very difficult to love, but they are also the most sensitive.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius, being the carefree and lighthearted creatures that they are, tend to shrug off most breakups or separations.  That’s because the easiest way to deal with anything is to laugh, even when things are tough or sad.  But it’s a trait that the next person will absolutely love.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns take time to let people into their lives, but it’s always worth it because they are the best people to love.  Anyone who has broken up with you will come to regret it.  The Capricorn simply needs to give him or herself time to heal after a nasty breakup, even if it might take a lot of it.</span>\n\nh/t

Phrases That Are Better Than Saying 'I Love You'","slug":"5-phrases-that-are-better-than-saying-i-love-you","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve ever fallen in love with someone then you know that love is not the type of emotion that can be adequately conveyed with three simple words.  Love is more than lusting after physical attraction, it’s more than anything we could ever imagine.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s about loving someone for who they are, flaws and all.  It’s about being a pillar of strength during tough times.  It’s about showing how much you care in little ways.  And one of the easiest ways to express love for your person is by using your words.  Words that mean more than a simple ‘I love you.’</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five phrases that express love better than the three words we’re all used to saying so often:</span>\n\n**‘I’m lucky to be yours’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’ve fallen for someone pretty hard, feeling lucky comes easy.  It happens in those moments when you’re least expecting it, when you’re suddenly overcome with an intense realization that you want this to last forever.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start to feel that you are unworthy of this person’s love, time, and attention, don’t forget to tell them how grateful you are to have them in your life.</span>\n\n**‘I’m sorry’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing when you’re wrong and when to apologize for your actions, words, or behaviors, is much more important than throwing out a simple ‘I love you.’  If you get caught up in a fight or make a huge mistake and know you were in the wrong, own up to it.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t need to waste your time trying to prove a point if you truly care about them.  Ask for forgiveness and move forward.</span>\n\n**‘I forgive you’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same way that you should apologize, also be willing to forgive.  When you know that your partner is truly sorry, and their transgressions are forgivable, don’t hesitate to forgive them.  Holding grudges and staying upset is wasted energy, energy that could be spent on building and nurturing your relationship.</span>\n\n**‘I support you’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouraging, motivating, and generally supporting your partner is something that they can’t get from anyone else.  It means the world when your partner has your back during times of uncertainty or change.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never be afraid to reassure them that they’re more than capable of achieving their goals and that you’ll be by their side every step of the way.</span>\n\n**‘I’m committed to you, to us’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing that your partner is entirely faithful and committed to the love you two share is an amazing feeling.  Never hesitate to tell them that your heart is theirs or how often you think about them.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open expression of commitment illustrates your love and sincerity for this feeling toward them.  When you’re feeling the love, tell them!</span>\n\nh/t

Ways the \"Old Soul\" Loves Differently","slug":"5-ways-the-old-soul-loves-differently","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, the ‘Old Soul.’  If you’re an old soul or have a friend who’s one, you know that we’re a little different from everyone else.  For whatever reason, we seem to handle ourselves better around older people and feel that our views on life are a little “before our time.”  This is why we enjoy spending time alone fairly often, because we’re misunderstood by our peers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that doesn’t mean we’re lonely people.  We’re just capable of enjoying the company we can provide ourselves.  We’re also pretty different when it comes to romance and relationships.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five things to know about how the old soul loves differently:</span>\n\n**They’re homebodies**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The homebody is the person who would rather stay in on Friday night instead of going out.  And they’re looking for a partner who shares this sentiment.  Bring over a bottle of wine, maybe some candles, and enjoy a relaxed night of conversation and good company.</span>\n\n**Not too concerned with material objects**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old souls are anything but materialistic, so don’t have high expectations for a giant diamond ring or brand new luxury car.  They enjoy expressing their affection through grand gestures that have deeper meaning, like love letters or poems.</span>\n\n**Old Souls communicate better than anyone else**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing games is something that the old soul simply doesn’t entertain when it comes to communication.  They’re going to tell you how they honestly feel, so don’t get caught too off guard by this; they have good intentions at heart.</span>\n\n**They only open up to select people**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul is almost incapable of

400;\">Recognize where you are now and how you ended up here, then you can start to move toward where you want to go.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Recognize that your happiness is just as important as other’s</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us get so caught up in being the generous, caring individuals that we are, that we sometimes forget that we have our own needs and desires that need to be fulfilled.  Always place value on </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, you can help those around you even better if you take the time to make yourself happy first.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Be a genuine and proud version of yourself</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part about being you is that no one else in the world can do </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as good as you do.  Don’t waste any time on trying to be like others.  Embrace every aspect of who you are; your ideas, strengths, weaknesses, flaws, talents, everything.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know you have endless potential, so be the best version of yourself that you can be.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>View each mistake as a lesson to be learned</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many people are afraid of failure.  What they do not understand is that we learn the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from failing.  Mistakes are fine, everyone will make plenty of them in their lifetime.  If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not truly living.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always be open to taking risks, knowing that should you fail, you have the ability to get up, shake it off and try again.  Your mistakes are the pathway to success.</span></p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/07/feature_image_te45656565mplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-07-13

While we sleep we disconnect our consciousness from the physical world and instead we connect more deeply with our higher self. This connection helps us create with greater ease.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s a reason why people tell you to “sleep on it” when you have a big decision-in our dream state we gain clarity and understanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are awesome creators from our sleeping state!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In addition to helping us solve our problems and deliberately create, sleep makes us feel good, boosts our immunity, and helps us heal from injury and illness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, whenever it’s possible, it’s a good idea to take advantage of sleep.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are 20 things you can do at bedtime to raise your vibration and become a better deliberate creator.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Enjoy!</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Bedtime DOs:</span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">Do give big hugs to the people you love before bedtime, if you live with them 🙂</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">After a rough day, do take a shower or bath before bedtime to wash off the stress and elevate your vibration before drifting off.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">Do get some water to put on your nightstand. Sometimes at night we get thirsty, and we always feel better when we’re hydrated.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">Do take a moment to snuggle into bed, and appreciate how comfortable your bedding and pajamas are.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">Do spend a few moments appreciating what went well during the day.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">Do ask a question of the universe before bed. We get lots of clarity from the dream state. You could ask something like “what should I do about that problem at work?” or “what kind of present would my best friend love for her birthday?”</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">Do set your intention to enjoy the next day.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">Do create a peaceful atmosphere in your bedroom. Peaceful places inspire peaceful feelings.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">If you like to watch television before bedtime, do be mindful of the programming you select. When we sleep, we often dwell on our last thoughts of the day, so be sure to select programming that’s light and* makes you feel good.*</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">Do close the blinds or invest in heavy curtains if you want to sleep in the next day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The light of day is hard to ignore when it’s shining on your face!</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">If you’ve got a few dollars to go shopping, do invest quality bedding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s easier to enjoy your sleep when you are comfortable! Being well-rested will help you manifest greater abundance, so comfy bedding *is worth every penny*.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">Do select a soothing alarm for the morning. Awaken to pleasing music or ringtones to gently transition into the daytime.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to forgive and forget before going to bed. A fight that isn’t resolved at night will just pick right back up in the morning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Why tarnish your tomorrow over something that happened today?</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">Do invest in an eye mask and earplugs if you are a light sleeper or if your partner snores.</span>\n15. <span class=\"s1\">Do try out a sleep mediation or sleep hypnosis, especially if you could use a boost!</span>\n16. <span class=\"s1\">Do avoid social media before bedtime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>There are a lot of things running through your newsfeed, some of which may have the potential to rattle your cage while you are wanting to relax.</span>\n17. <span class=\"s1\">Do take it easy if you find yourself wide awake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Instead of* trying* to fall asleep, go along with the wakefulness without struggling.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can tell yourself “I’m just going to relax and take this opportunity to fantasize about pleasant things” and “when my body needs sleep it will shut me down.” The less you struggle, the easier it is to unwind. After all, if you’re going to be awake, you might as well be awake and happy!</span>\n18. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to review your “to do list” in the morning instead of at night. You can’t get tomorrow’s work done today.</span>\n19. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to go to sleep at a reasonable time (whatever that means for you of course!). Sometimes there are reasons we have to stay up extra late, but when you have the opportunity to enjoy a good night’s rest, take advantage of it!</span>\n20. <span class=\"s1\">If you’re a lucid dreamer, do set your intention to have a lucid dream.

Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way. Because they like to avoid confrontation, Virgos will often become incredibly passive aggressive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not going to hold a grudge, but they’re not going to forget about what you did, either.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a peacekeeper, the Libra’s scales fit perfectly here. Balance is valued in everything, especially relationships. This means that confrontation is often avoided, and emotions get bottled up. Even when they’re at the peak of their frustration, Libras do their best to wear a happy face as they hold back their rage. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the hurt is great enough, they are definitely capable of holding a grudge.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other signs, the Scorpio doesn’t let out anger as it comes to them. You can always tell if a Scorpio is angry by looking into their eyes. Their eyes will say more than anything. They’re usually venting in their minds, planning their next move. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they suddenly get really quiet and you see angry eyes come out, give them some space. And don’t try to force them into anything before they’re ready.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surefire ways to piss off a Sagittarius include dishonesty, disloyalty, being cruel and spewing hate speech. While they tend to be a patient sign, and they don’t angry very often, when they do get angry they’re not interested in playing nice, </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at all</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know they’re starting to get angry when the heavy sarcasm starts pouring out.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Earth sign, Capricorns aren’t too pent up with anger. They like to keep things easy-going, but also have a threshold you can reach. You’re most likely to piss them off by accidentally messing up the ‘zen’ of their space. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns get angry for seemingly random reasons, and they don’t like to express it. They enjoy sulking before they’re ready to throw a tantrum.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguing is the last thing the Aquarius wants to do, so that’s what they tend to avoid, choosing to completely ignore people instead. If they can’t seem to get away from whatever it is that’s upsetting them, they’re likely to blow up just because of how frustrated they are. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who they’re arguing with, they may or may not want to continue the relationship.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pisces is somewhat volatile, meaning you never know what’s going to light their fuse. If they’re having a bad day already, it’s easier for them to explode. But, they don’t enjoy confrontation and would rather avoid it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a smoke or a drink won’t help, they know that crying will. Of all the signs, Pisceans tend to cry the most when it comes to anger and frustration.</span>\n\nh/t [**SpiritScience**](http://thespiritscience.net/2016/07/13/how-each-sign-of-the-zodiac-expresses-their-anger/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently. Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel.

We identify all the things we DON’T have, and we go to work to try to make them happen. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, we focus on the boyfriend we don’t have yet, the promotion we haven’t gotten, or the weight we haven’t lost yet.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We focus on what is lacking in order to try to create what is wanted into our realities.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this strategy doesn’t work! You’ve gotta make peace with what is first.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">When life isn’t good enough as it is</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you focused on why your life isn’t good enough as it is, you only amplify the “my life isn’t good enough” vibe. Then, thanks to the Law of Attraction, your life will continue to feel “not good enough!” Your reality will always reflect back to you your dominant belief structure.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, you can’t focus on how much your hate your current home and hope you’ll be able to find one you’ll love. Sure, you may move and you may find a new home.  However, rest assured, you will be just as dissatisfied with your new home as you were with the old one. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is because with the LOA we are always creating whatever is a match to our dominant thought patterns.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If we believe where we live sucks, then where we live must continue to suck. It doesn’t matter where we go or how many times we move.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You’d be much more successful in making peace with your current home, and coming to love it as it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Once you make peace with your current home, you become a match to homes you love. </span><span class=\"s1\">The universe will knock its socks off to match whatever you’re putting out there.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you want your life to be great, you have to start projecting the vibe that says “my life is great now!” This is done by making peace with what is, and loving it as it stands.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why so many people project dissatisfaction over satisfaction</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I know making peace with what is can seem a bit counterintuitive. </span>\n\nMost people have been raised to believe they have to improve their lives, and that their lives aren’t good enough as they are. People are also often taught to evaluate the problems in their lives more closely than the blessings.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this social programming keeps many of us stuck in a rut. This is why you know a guy who’s on his third failed marriage. This is why you have a friend who is always sick. This is why so many people go on a different diet every year.  \n</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we focus on what’s lacking, we create more lack. On the surface things may change, but it’s just the same shit, different day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remind yourself of this principle of the LOA on a regular basis. When you find yourself criticizing where you are, remember you are perpetuating lack. Being happy where you stand will make you a match to people, events and situations that reinforce your happiness, not your lack.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">How do you make peace with what is?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">One thing you can do right now to make peace with where you are is to play the “perspective game.” The perspective game enables you to make peace with where you are in the present moment.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To play this game, step into someone else’s shoes and evaluate your life from an alternative perspective.  List out the things you have, and view them from the perspective of* not* having them. Imagine living a life where the things you have right now are still just dreams to you. The bigger the list, the better.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here is a short list of things I have in my life.  To play the perspective game, I write out the list, and then take a moment imagining my life without these blessings: </span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">I have two healthy and adorable children.</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">I have a wonderful husband who loves me and treats me like a queen.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">I have a great relationship with my brother. He is a kindred spirit to me.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">I have close friends I get to spend lots of time with.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">I have a bunch of friendly and positive clients and I run my own business.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">I’m healthy and in good shape.</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve had an exceptional education, and I have lots of skills and knowledge that benefit me because of it.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">I live near the beach.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">I drive my own car.</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">I get to vacation several times every year.</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">I own my own home.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">I have money in the bank and my expenses are always paid with ease.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">I really like all of my neighbors.</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve got an awesome phone and computer and all kinds of cool technological gadgets.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To me, each of the items on this list seems very normal to me, because they are each a part of my current reality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, these things are HUGE dreams for some people out there. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In fact, just looking at this list makes me feel like my life is pretty great.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  I can’t even imagine living a life without my relationships, my health or my education. Yet,* *there are people out there who live without these blessings every day.</span></span>\n\nIt’s very hard for me to justify dissatisfaction with my life when I look at things from this perspective.  I’m just too grateful for what I have when I look at it this way.\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why perspective matters</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look at this list through the perspective of those who don’t have what I already have, it reminds me just how blessed I truly am. When I look at my life through this lens, it’s easy for me to make peace with where I am. </span>\n\n***Related Article:**[20 Heartfelt Ways to Say Thank You](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/06/heartfelt-ways-to-say-thank-you/ \"LOA Article\")*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look through my life focused on what I *haven’t *created or achieved, it’s much, much easier to feel unfulfilled. I’m not at peace when I evaluate my life based on my unfulfilled dreams.  How at peace I am with my life has everything to do with which perspective I choose to take.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In playing this perspective game, you come to see all of the wonderful things you have already created in your life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You are focused on what you HAVE rather than what you DON’T have.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This projects a vibe that shouts out “I am fortunate in so many ways!”</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A message like this becomes reinforced in your reality, allowing more and more good things to come into your life. The universe must continue to bless you, if you believe you are blessed.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Work within the paradox!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you are wanting to use the Law of Attraction to improve your quality of life, make sure you are working within the paradox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You’ve gotta make peace with what is before something better will come along. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remember, your life is great *right here and now, regardless of where you stand.  *There are always dreams you have achieved, and there are always reasons to be grateful.* *When you acknowledge this truth and declare your life to be great, your life will reflect greatness back to you in spades.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">How is your life already great? Why is where you stand a wonderful place to be?

Their deep loyalty to the people they choose to spend their time with is an admirable and sometimes redeeming quality.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They can hold grudges</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurting the Scorpio is a very dramatic endeavor. If you wrong them, a grudge will start brewing within them the likes of which you’ve never seen. They believe everyone should be as deeply loyal as they are, so when it is not reciprocated, forgiveness is the last thing on their mind.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They expect the best for themselves</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios’ tough love nature ultimately comes from their high standards and expectations of those around them (and themselves). They know what they want, they know what they deserve, and they have no trouble telling others how they feel. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Scorpio is always giving their best, they expect it in return. But, one pitfall of this attitude is that Scorpios are also very critical of themselves, to the point that it becomes incredibly detrimental to their lives.</span></p>\n\n<p>h/t<a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/scorpios-worst-best-zodiac/1258537/\"><em>* Elite Daily *</em></a></p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/07/feature_image_temscorpplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-07-27 22:00:42","created_by":3,"updated_at":"2016-07-27 22:00:42","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-27 22:00:42","published_by":3},{"id":192,"uuid":"57e70796-c7d9-4580-9098-33f996895e36","title":"5 Ways Toxic People Manipulate You","slug":"5-ways-toxic-people-manipulate-you","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxic people make their way into our lives sometimes without us even realizing it.

Maybe you’re addicted to playing video games, maybe you’re addicted to working out, or maybe you’ve dabbled with addiction to hard drugs; either way, each and every addiction is indicative of a bigger problem in a person’s life.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And each zodiac sign is complete with its own set of problems that we have to deal with.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addiction can be a very detrimental aspect of life if it is not recognized until it’s too late, so here is a bit of insight as to what each sign is most likely to gravitate toward:</span>\n\n**Aries **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(March 21 – April 19) | Cocaine</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the youngest signs of the zodiac, Aries are often of the opinion that life doesn’t move quick enough. Their personalities are usually a big mess of confidence mixed together with neediness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re likely to choose cocaine over other substances because it reinforces their already fantastical perspective that they’re always slightly ahead of everyone else.</span>\n\n**Taurus **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(April 20 – May 20) | Cannabis / Food / Both</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus have almost too much patience for their own good. This patience oftentimes transforms into laziness, which means that the Taurus isn’t going to go out of his or her way to develop an addiction to crack or meth, simply because it’s a lot harder to find.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food is the most likely addiction; pick up the phone, punch in some numbers, and food is at your door within 20 minutes.</span>\n\n**Gemini **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(May 21 – June 20) | Social Media</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain studies have found that Facebook can be more addictive than alcohol, a notion that Gemini can easily understand. Gemini hide from their feelings by compulsively communicating, jumping from conversation to the next.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They tend to enjoy doing a variety of different things, but never really get too involved with any of them. </span>\n\n**Cancer **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(June 21 – July 22) | Heroin</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heroin suits the Cancer almost perfectly, as they prefer to retreat into reclusivity when the world around them starts to crumble. Wherever they gain the most comfort and security is where the Cancer gravitates to, and heroin has oft been described as being taken to a world literally everything is </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">okay</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as if you were a baby again without a care in the world.</span>\n\n**Leo **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(July 23 – August 22) | Shopping</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos tend to have materialistic tendencies, and vanity is one of their hallmark characteristics, so it makes perfect sense that a Leo would struggle with finances and irresponsible spending. Leo women like to sport designer clothing and expensive jewelry, while Leo men prefer to spend their money on new gadgets and luxury vehicles.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all plays on the bigger issue of the Leo’s innate desire to be in the limelight as much as possible.</span>\n\n**Virgo **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(August 23 – September 22) | Codependency</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgo people naturally gravitate toward being in positions of caretaking, often putting their unique ability to problem solve and care for others to good use on those they care about. The downside to this trait becomes obvious when they put </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too much</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focus on the well being of others, and not enough on their own.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos sometimes unconsciously seek out people who are struggling in life, seemingly unable to care for themselves. This lets them put their own life problems on the backburner in order to fix someone else’s.</span>\n\n**Libra **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(September 23 – October 22) | Love</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically, as a sign that represents fairness and balance, Libras often struggle to embody the values that their sign is known for. From the start, they expect life to operate on a level of fairness that simply doesn’t exist, which frustrates them to the point of tears.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add to the fire, they have a constant need for a partner to make them feel balanced. The Libra should focus on finding balance in their own life by getting rid of ridiculous expectations, and by not treating relationships like they’re the end-all-be-all.</span>\n\n**Scorpio **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(October 23 – November 21) | Sex / Porn</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios are notorious for their adventurous nature in the bedroom; they’re highly passionate beings who consider sex to be very important in a relationship. Tie this in with their secluded and voyeuristic nature, and porn becomes a preferred sexual outlet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complex and somewhat confusing, while Scorpios truly desire intimate connection and passion with others, it’s also something that scares them the most.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(November 22 – December 21) | Gambling / Drinking</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagittarius is a sign closely tied to Jupiter, the planet of luck and gifts. They have a very broad view on life, always seeking out new information with a yearning to understand. As a sign of luck, they’re often quite optimistic when it comes to taking risks in life. A quality that easily carries over to betting money and throwing dice, or even drinking and driving.</span>\n\n**Capricorn **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(December 22 – January 19) | Pills / Eating Disorders</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns have a natural desire to be “high status” in society. So they’re most likely to have an addiction that can be passed off as somewhat acceptable, like pharmaceuticals. To keep a clean reputation and rise through the ranks in their career, having an addiction that is “prescribed” is a great way to hide it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To fight this, the Capricorn should shift gears a little bit. Change the focus from what society values to what our higher selves value.</span>\n\n**Aquarius **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(January 20 – February 18) | Video Games / Body Mutilation</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aquarius likes to handle its feelings in small and very specific ways. And on top of that, they tend to try to ‘solve’ all of their emotions, rather than simply experiencing them on a real level. Video games provide a fantasy-like outlet through which they can channel their emotions, while body harming provides the physical outlet of releasing emotion without actually having to experience any sadness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To solve this, the Aquarius needs to focus more on offering themselves the same kind of care and compassion that they easily give to everyone else.</span>\n\n**Pisces **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(February 19 – March 20) | Alcohol</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the most empathic and sensitive signs of the zodiac, Pisces’ decision-making processes involve a lot of emotion. Their high degree of empathy means they’re usually attracted to people that are going no where. But because they fear hurting others, they tend to be reluctant about putting up healthy boundaries that might keep others out. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which makes alcohol the perfect way to escape having to deal with any of it. Fortunately, they also tend to be more in tune with their higher selves, and will likely find a better way to handle their problems.</span>\n\nh/t [**Elite Daily**](http://elitedaily.com/life/addictions-for-all-zodiac-signs/1464889/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addiction takes hold in almost everyone’s life, regardless of who we are, because addiction is unique for everyone. Maybe you’re addicted to playing video games, maybe you’re addicted to working out, or maybe you’ve dabbled with addiction to hard drugs; either way, each and every addiction is indicative of a bigger problem in a person’s life.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And each zodiac sign is complete with its own set of problems that we have to deal with.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addiction can be a very detrimental aspect of life if it is not recognized until it’s too late, so here is a bit of insight as to what each sign is most likely to gravitate toward:</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Aries *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(March 21 – April 19) | Cocaine</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the youngest signs of the zodiac, Aries are often of the opinion that life doesn’t move quick enough. Their personalities are usually a big mess of confidence mixed together with neediness.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re likely to choose cocaine over other substances because it reinforces their already fantastical perspective that they’re always slightly ahead of everyone else.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Taurus *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(April 20 – May 20) | Cannabis / Food / Both</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus have almost too much patience for their own good. This patience oftentimes transforms into laziness, which means that the Taurus isn’t going to go out of his or her way to develop an addiction to crack or meth, simply because it’s a lot harder to find.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food is the most likely addiction; pick up the phone, punch in some numbers, and food is at your door within 20 minutes.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Gemini *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(May 21 – June 20) | Social Media</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain studies have found that Facebook can be more addictive than alcohol, a notion that Gemini can easily understand. Gemini hide from their feelings by compulsively communicating, jumping from conversation to the next.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They tend to enjoy doing a variety of different things, but never really get too involved with any of them. </span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Cancer *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(June 21 – July 22) | Heroin</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heroin suits the Cancer almost perfectly, as they prefer to retreat into reclusivity when the world around them starts to crumble. Wherever they gain the most comfort and security is where the Cancer gravitates to, and heroin has oft been described as being taken to a world literally everything is </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">okay</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as if you were a baby again without a care in the world.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Leo *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(July 23 – August 22) | Shopping</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos tend to have materialistic tendencies, and vanity is one of their hallmark characteristics, so it makes perfect sense that a Leo would struggle with finances and irresponsible spending. Leo women like to sport designer clothing and expensive jewelry, while Leo men prefer to spend their money on new gadgets and luxury vehicles.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all plays on the bigger issue of the Leo’s innate desire to be in the limelight as much as possible.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Virgo *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(August 23 – September 22) | Codependency</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgo people naturally gravitate toward being in positions of caretaking, often putting their unique ability to problem solve and care for others to good use on those they care about. The downside to this trait becomes obvious when they put </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too much</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focus on the well being of others, and not enough on their own.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos sometimes unconsciously seek out people who are struggling in life, seemingly unable to care for themselves. This lets them put their own life problems on the backburner in order to fix someone else’s.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Libra *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(September 23 – October 22) | Love</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically, as a sign that represents fairness and balance, Libras often struggle to embody the values that their sign is known for.

It makes sense though, doesn’t it? The universe will always influence who we are as people. Just as the Cancer will always be loving and caring, and the Leo proud and passionate.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking to find love, learning a bit about what your sign desires in a partner might just be the difference between a lasting, loving relationship, and a drama-filled nightmare.</span>\n\n\n## **Aries (March 21-April 19)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a youthful fire sign, Aries have a fervent energy and enthusiasm for life. Your leadership skills often let you control the flow of any relationship, which is good because you’re usually the one who is down-to-earth and level-headed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try not to put the cart before the horse, and people will flock to your ever burning flame.</span>\n\n\n## **Taurus (April 20-May 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus have a weak spot for physical intimacy. When the physical side of a relationship picks up heavy and fast, you’re likely to start falling in love at the same time. This is largely because of how in tune you are sensually with your body.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you do find yourself in a faithful relationship, you’re happy just ebbing and flowing within it. Which is why your dream is to settle down together somewhere remote and secluded.</span>\n\n\n## **Gemini (May 21-June 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart, funny and always looking on the bright side, Gemini always make great partners. They’re full of unique and intelligent ideas. They’re also incredibly romantic, which means they often fall in love and stay in love when they adore their partner. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might want nothing more than to be with your significant other 24/7, it is good to remember to give each other space, and to communicate with each other as much as possible.</span>\n\n\n## **Cancer (June 21-July 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Cancers tend to fall face first into love (and hard), they keep a bit of reserved skepticism. You’re searching for someone who will be your ‘partner,’ in every sense of the word. Which is why they prefer partners who are ambitious and motivated.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found a partner, you’re their number one fan. And your superb listening skills and sense of humor will keep them around for years to come.</span>\n\n\n## **Leo (July 23-August 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Leos are so charismatic, confident and warm, they rarely struggle to find love. But there natural ability to attract others doesn’t keep them from being completely loyal once they’ve fallen for someone. And they tend to fall in love often, and hard. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Leo, you are naturally territorial, but it’s only because of how intense your love is. You need a bit of praise and adoration here and there to keep you happy.</span>\n\n\n## **Virgo (August 23-September 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos sometimes forget just how easy to love they really are. And they don’t like to show any sort of vulnerability. These two notions combined mean that they typically prefer to operate under jealousy and accusations, rather than playing it cool like they so often want to do. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let yourself become consumed by the idea of love. You need to give people the chance to love you.</span>\n\n\n## **Libra (September 23-October 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras are naturally independent and ambitious, which means that love is just another thing in this world that they can choose to pursue, or not pursue. This also means that when they do pick a partner, they’re nothing short of the high standards that have been set. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your high levels of self-respect often have you forcing partners to wait some time before you actually commit to anything.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found love, your focus will shift toward stability within the relationship.</span>\n\n\n## **Scorpio (October 23-November 21)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa, watch out, the Scorpio is coming through. Passionate, sexual, stubborn and intense, the Scorpio likes to follow the heart, rather than the brain. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is highly valued by Scorpios, and they’re used to getting their way, so their relationships often include a good bit of drama. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calm and rational partners are perfect for the Scorpio; you fit best with Pisces or Cancer.</span>\n\n\n## **Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the ultimate free-spirit, Sagittarius like to treat love like a journey, one that they’re not afraid to embark on. When it comes to matters of the heart, you enjoy throwing inhibition to the wind, jumping head-first into love.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, your intellectual nature attracts similar-minded partners, ones that share your enthusiasm for novelty experiences and seeing the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as you want, you will likely find a partner who’s just as afraid of settling down as you are.</span>\n\n\n## **Capricorn (December 22-January 19)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns like having something to work on. This is easy for them when it comes to relationships because they’re really good at seeing big-picture type of stuff. A happy, stable life with the person that they love and call their best friend is something to work toward. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re quite serious when it comes to life, so you expect your partner to be as well. Reckless, crazy passion has no place in your world.</span>\n\n\n## **Aquarius (January 20-February 18)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aquarius, your big heart often reflects the type of love you desire most: passionate, intense, hot and long-lasting. If you find yourself in love with someone, don’t be afraid to be the selfless person you are. Enjoy devoting time and energy to your relationship without playing games.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know when you’ve found the right person, because you’ll never want to let go once you do.</span>\n\n\n## **Pisces (February 19-March 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces, one of the things you fear most is missing out on your chance to fall in love. You’re highly sensitive, which means your moods can be somewhat polarized at times. Good things in your relationship have you feeling happy, euphoric and carefree, while the bad things often ruin your entire day.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your naturally sweet and caring nature is redeeming, however, as you often put your partner’s needs before your own. Just remember not to sacrifice too much of your own life for the sake of theirs.</span>\n\nh/t [**EliteDaily**](http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling in love is different for everyone, and our zodiac signs have a lot to do with how it happens.

This is largely because of how in tune you are sensually with your body.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you do find yourself in a faithful relationship, you’re happy just ebbing and flowing within it. Which is why your dream is to settle down together somewhere remote and secluded.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"geminimay21june20\"><strong>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart, funny and always looking on the bright side, Gemini always make great partners. They’re full of unique and intelligent ideas. They’re also incredibly romantic, which means they often fall in love and stay in love when they adore their partner. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might want nothing more than to be with your significant other 24/7, it is good to remember to give each other space, and to communicate with each other as much as possible.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancerjune21july22\"><strong>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Cancers tend to fall face first into love (and hard), they keep a bit of reserved skepticism. You’re searching for someone who will be your ‘partner,’ in every sense of the word. Which is why they prefer partners who are ambitious and motivated.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found a partner, you’re their number one fan. And your superb listening skills and sense of humor will keep them around for years to come.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leojuly23august22\"><strong>Leo (July 23-August 22)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Leos are so charismatic, confident and warm, they rarely struggle to find love. But there natural ability to attract others doesn’t keep them from being completely loyal once they’ve fallen for someone. And they tend to fall in love often, and hard. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Leo, you are naturally territorial, but it’s only because of how intense your love is. You need a bit of praise and adoration here and there to keep you happy.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"virgoaugust23september22\"><strong>Virgo (August 23-September 22)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos sometimes forget just how easy to love they really are. And they don’t like to show any sort of vulnerability. These two notions combined mean that they typically prefer to operate under jealousy and accusations, rather than playing it cool like they so often want to do. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let yourself become consumed by the idea of love. You need to give people the chance to love you.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"libraseptember23october22\"><strong>Libra (September 23-October 22)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras are naturally independent and ambitious, which means that love is just another thing in this world that they can choose to pursue, or not pursue. This also means that when they do pick a partner, they’re nothing short of the high standards that have been set. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your high levels of self-respect often have you forcing partners to wait some time before you actually commit to anything.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found love, your focus will shift toward stability within the relationship.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scorpiooctober23november21\"><strong>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa, watch out, the Scorpio is coming through. Passionate, sexual, stubborn and intense, the Scorpio likes to follow the heart, rather than the brain. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is highly valued by Scorpios, and they’re used to getting their way, so their relationships often include a good bit of drama. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calm and rational partners are perfect for the Scorpio; you fit best with Pisces or Cancer.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sagittariusnovember22december21\"><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the ultimate free-spirit, Sagittarius like to treat love like a journey, one that they’re not afraid to embark on. When it comes to matters of the heart, you enjoy throwing inhibition to the wind, jumping head-first into love.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, your intellectual nature attracts similar-minded partners, ones that share your enthusiasm for novelty experiences and seeing the world.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as you want, you will likely find a partner who’s just as afraid of settling down as you are.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"capricorndecember22january19\"><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns like having something to work on. This is easy for them when it comes to relationships because they’re really good at seeing big-picture type of stuff. A happy, stable life with the person that they love and call their best friend is something to work toward. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re quite serious when it comes to life, so you expect your partner to be as well. Reckless, crazy passion has no place in your world.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"aquariusjanuary20february18\"><strong>Aquarius (January 20-February 18)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aquarius, your big heart often reflects the type of love you desire most: passionate, intense, hot and long-lasting. If you find yourself in love with someone, don’t be afraid to be the selfless person you are. Enjoy devoting time and energy to your relationship without playing games.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know when you’ve found the right person, because you’ll never want to let go once you do.</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"piscesfebruary19march20\"><strong>Pisces (February 19-March 20)</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces, one of the things you fear most is missing out on your chance to fall in love. You’re highly sensitive, which means your moods can be somewhat polarized at times. Good things in your relationship have you feeling happy, euphoric and carefree, while the bad things often ruin your entire day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your naturally sweet and caring nature is redeeming, however, as you often put your partner’s needs before your own. Just remember not to sacrifice too much of your own life for the sake of theirs.</span></p>\n\n<p>h/t <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/\"><strong>EliteDaily</strong></a></p>","image":"http://dev.groupxondemand.com/content/images/2016/08/feature_image_lovetemplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"2016-08-05 07:40:37","created_by":3,"updated_at":"2016-08-05 07:40:37","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-08-05 07:40:37","published_by":3},{"id":201,"uuid":"57d518af-f1e4-47cb-8e31-be62280af1b4","title":"Research Finds: Marrying a Smart Woman Helps Men Live Longer","slug":"research-finds-marrying-a-smart-woman-helps-men-live-longer","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men, when you go through the list of things you desire in a partner, does intelligence ever top your list?

Whether it’s a big promotion at work or a crazy story from the weekend, your communication is valued and genuine.</span>\n\n**They help you see from other perspectives**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s incredibly easy to get so caught up in your own life that you forget there’s an entire world that exists outside of your own. Your long distance BFF, who is outside of it all, knows exactly how to bring you back to a grounded state: they’ll tell you how it is, no sugarcoating. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who only has your best interests in mind, the long distance BFF will always give you real advice when you need it. You don’t need to worry about them having ulterior motives or wanting to stir up drama, because they’re a thousand miles away.</span>\n\n**The time you do get to spend together is priceless**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Reunited and it feels so good’ has never been more accurate than when two long distance BFFs come together after a long time apart. This is definitely one case where absence makes the heart grow fonder. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the two of you talk on the phone regularly, you never run out of things to say and share when you finally meet up in person.</span>\n\n**Your relationship takes work from both of you, work you can be proud of**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every person who’s ever had a BFF knows that it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.

Laws of Happiness That Will Change Your Life","slug":"5-laws-of-happiness-that-will-change-your-life","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How often do you think of your happiness? Do you fantasize about the life you want to live, the job you want to work, the friends you want to have, the partner you want to be with? Maybe happiness, for you, has nothing to do with any of those things, but at least you know what it is you want.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people live their entire lives unhappy and often have no idea why. The reality is that it’s because they’re not being truthful to themselves. They lie and lie to themselves, just to avoid their own reality, their own truth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happiness can be hard to achieve, but it is possible. Here are five laws of happiness that will help you work toward the life you want and deserve:</span>\n\n**Never sacrifice your integrity, for it is at the core of a happy life**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conflict is a natural part of life, it will always be something you have to deal with. What you might now know is that a majority of the conflict in your life arises when you’re not being true to yourself. Behaving differently than what we feel at our deepest being causes us tremendous grief.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on who you are and what truly makes you happy.

Do you fantasize about the life you want to live, the job you want to work, the friends you want to have, the partner you want to be with? Maybe happiness, for you, has nothing to do with any of those things, but at least you know what it is you want.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people live their entire lives unhappy and often have no idea why. The reality is that it’s because they’re not being truthful to themselves. They lie and lie to themselves, just to avoid their own reality, their own truth.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happiness can be hard to achieve, but it is possible. Here are five laws of happiness that will help you work toward the life you want and deserve:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Never sacrifice your integrity, for it is at the core of a happy life</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conflict is a natural part of life, it will always be something you have to deal with. What you might now know is that a majority of the conflict in your life arises when you’re not being true to yourself. Behaving differently than what we feel at our deepest being causes us tremendous grief.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on who you are and what truly makes you happy. It is only there that you will ever find happiness.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Happiness is born from freedom, and freedom is born from courage</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes happiness is right under your nose, but you can’t get to it because you’re not willing to step outside of your comfort zone.
