For example, to change payload\n     keys to underscore (instead of dasherized), you might use the following code:\n      ```javascript\n     export default var PostSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n       payloadKeyFromModelName: function(modelName) {\n         return Ember.String.underscore(modelName);\n       }\n     });\n     ```\n     @property modelName\n     @type String\n     @readonly\n    */\n    modelName: null\n  });\n\n  // if `Ember.setOwner` is defined, accessing `this.container` is\n  // deprecated (but functional). In \"standard\" Ember usage, this\n  // deprecation is actually created via an `.extend` of the factory\n  // inside the container itself, but that only happens on models\n  // with MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS enabled :(\n  if (_ember[\"default\"].setOwner) {\n    Object.defineProperty(Model.prototype, 'container', {\n      configurable: true,\n      enumerable: false,\n      get: function get() {\n        (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.deprecate)('Using the injected `container` is deprecated.

For instance, if a record is\n    newly created and has not yet been sent to the adapter to be saved,\n    it would be in the `root.loaded.created.uncommitted` state.  If a\n    record has had local modifications made to it that are in the\n    process of being saved, the record would be in the\n    `root.loaded.updated.inFlight` state. (This state paths will be\n    explained in more detail below.)\n  \n    Events are sent by the record or its store to the record's\n    `currentState` property. How the state reacts to these events is\n    dependent on which state it is in. In some states, certain events\n    will be invalid and will cause an exception to be raised.\n  \n    States are hierarchical and every state is a substate of the\n    `RootState`. For example, a record can be in the\n    `root.deleted.uncommitted` state, then transition into the\n    `root.deleted.inFlight` state. If a child state does not implement\n    an event handler, the state manager will attempt to invoke the event\n    on all parent states until the root state is reached. The state\n    hierarchy of a record is described in terms of a path string. You\n    can determine a record's current state by getting the state's\n    `stateName` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    record.get('currentState.stateName');\n    //=> \"root.created.uncommitted\"\n     ```\n  \n    The hierarchy of valid states that ship with ember data looks like\n    this:\n  \n    ```text\n    * root\n      * deleted\n        * saved\n        * uncommitted\n        * inFlight\n      * empty\n      * loaded\n        * created\n          * uncommitted\n          * inFlight\n        * saved\n        * updated\n          * uncommitted\n          * inFlight\n      * loading\n    ```\n  \n    The `DS.Model` states are themselves stateless. What that means is\n    that, the hierarchical states that each of *those* points to is a\n    shared data structure. For performance reasons, instead of each\n    record getting its own copy of the hierarchy of states, each record\n    points to this global, immutable shared instance. How does a state\n    know which record it should be acting on? We pass the record\n    instance into the state's event handlers as the first argument.\n  \n    The record passed as the first parameter is where you should stash\n    state about the record if needed; you should never store data on the state\n    object itself.\n  \n    ### Events and Flags\n  \n    A state may implement zero or more events and flags.\n  \n    #### Events\n  \n    Events are named functions that are invoked when sent to a record. The\n    record will first look for a method with the given name on the\n    current state. If no method is found, it will search the current\n    state's parent, and then its grandparent, and so on until reaching\n    the top of the hierarchy. If the root is reached without an event\n    handler being found, an exception will be raised. This can be very\n    helpful when debugging new features.\n  \n    Here's an example implementation of a state with a `myEvent` event handler:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    aState: DS.State.create({\n      myEvent: function(manager, param) {\n        console.log(\"Received myEvent with\", param);\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n  \n    To trigger this event:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    record.send('myEvent', 'foo');\n    //=> \"Received myEvent with foo\"\n    ```\n  \n    Note that an optional parameter can be sent to a record's `send()` method,\n    which will be passed as the second parameter to the event handler.\n  \n    Events should transition to a different state if appropriate. This can be\n    done by calling the record's `transitionTo()` method with a path to the\n    desired state. The state manager will attempt to resolve the state path\n    relative to the current state. If no state is found at that path, it will\n    attempt to resolve it relative to the current state's parent, and then its\n    parent, and so on until the root is reached. For example, imagine a hierarchy\n    like this:\n  \n        * created\n          * uncommitted <-- currentState\n          * inFlight\n        * updated\n          * inFlight\n  \n    If we are currently in the `uncommitted` state, calling\n    `transitionTo('inFlight')` would transition to the `created.inFlight` state,\n    while calling `transitionTo('updated.inFlight')` would transition to\n    the `updated.inFlight` state.\n  \n    Remember that *only events* should ever cause a state transition. You should\n    never call `transitionTo()` from outside a state's event handler. If you are\n    tempted to do so, create a new event and send that to the state manager.\n  \n    #### Flags\n  \n    Flags are Boolean values that can be used to introspect a record's current\n    state in a more user-friendly way than examining its state path. For example,\n    instead of doing this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var statePath = record.get('stateManager.currentPath');\n    if (statePath === 'created.inFlight') {\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    You can say:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    if (record.get('isNew') && record.get('isSaving')) {\n      doSomething();\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    If your state does not set a value for a given flag, the value will\n    be inherited from its parent (or the first place in the state hierarchy\n    where it is defined).\n  \n    The current set of flags are defined below. If you want to add a new flag,\n    in addition to the area below, you will also need to declare it in the\n    `DS.Model` class.\n  \n  \n     * [isEmpty](DS.Model.html#property_isEmpty)\n     * [isLoading](DS.Model.html#property_isLoading)\n     * [isLoaded](DS.Model.html#property_isLoaded)\n     * [isDirty](DS.Model.html#property_isDirty)\n     * [isSaving](DS.Model.html#property_isSaving)\n     * [isDeleted](DS.Model.html#property_isDeleted)\n     * [isNew](DS.Model.html#property_isNew)\n     * [isValid](DS.Model.html#property_isValid)\n  \n    @namespace DS\n    @class RootState\n  */\n\n  function _didSetProperty(internalModel, context) {\n    if (context.value === context.originalValue) {\n      delete internalModel._attributes[context.name];\n      internalModel.send('propertyWasReset', context.name);\n    } else if (context.value !== context.oldValue) {\n      internalModel.send('becomeDirty');\n    }\n\n    internalModel.updateRecordArraysLater();\n  }\n\n  // Implementation notes:\n  //\n  // Each state has a boolean value for all of the following flags:\n  //\n  // * isLoaded: The record has a populated `data` property. When a\n  //   record is loaded via `store.find`, `isLoaded` is false\n  //   until the adapter sets it. When a record is created locally,\n  //   its `isLoaded` property is always true.\n  // * isDirty: The record has local changes that have not yet been\n  //   saved by the adapter.

 `DS.belongsTo` takes an optional hash as a second parameter, currently\n    supported options are:\n  \n    - `async`: A boolean value used to explicitly declare this to be an async relationship.\n    - `inverse`: A string used to identify the inverse property on a\n      related model in a One-To-Many relationship. See [Explicit Inverses](#toc_explicit-inverses)\n  \n    #### One-To-One\n    To declare a one-to-one relationship between two models, use\n    `DS.belongsTo`:\n  \n    ```app/models/user.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      profile: DS.belongsTo('profile')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/models/profile.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      user: DS.belongsTo('user')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    #### One-To-Many\n    To declare a one-to-many relationship between two models, use\n    `DS.belongsTo` in combination with `DS.hasMany`, like this:\n  \n    ```app/models/post.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      comments: DS.hasMany('comment')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/models/comment.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      post: DS.belongsTo('post')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    You can avoid passing a string as the first parameter.

You can specify which property on the related model is\n    the inverse using `DS.hasMany`'s `inverse` option:\n  \n    ```app/models/comment.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      onePost: DS.belongsTo('post'),\n      twoPost: DS.belongsTo('post'),\n      redPost: DS.belongsTo('post'),\n      bluePost: DS.belongsTo('post')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/models/post.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      comments: DS.hasMany('comment', {\n        inverse: 'redPost'\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    You can also specify an inverse on a `belongsTo`, which works how\n    you'd expect.\n  \n    @namespace\n    @method hasMany\n    @for DS\n    @param {String} type (optional) type of the relationship\n    @param {Object} options (optional) a hash of options\n    @return {Ember.computed} relationship\n  */\n  function hasMany(type, options) {\n    if ((typeof type === \"undefined\" ? \"undefined\" : _typeof(type)) === 'object') {\n      options = type;\n      type = undefined;\n    }\n\n    (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.assert)(\"The first argument to DS.hasMany must be a string representing a model type key, not an instance of \" + _ember[\"default\"].inspect(type) + \".

To retrieve a record\n    for a specific id, use `DS.Store`'s `findRecord()` method:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    store.findRecord('person', 123).then(function (person) {\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the store will talk to your backend using a standard\n    REST mechanism. You can customize how the store talks to your\n    backend by specifying a custom adapter:\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Adapter.extend({\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    You can learn more about writing a custom adapter by reading the `DS.Adapter`\n    documentation.\n  \n    ### Store createRecord() vs. push() vs. pushPayload()\n  \n    The store provides multiple ways to create new record objects. They have\n    some subtle differences in their use which are detailed below:\n  \n    [createRecord](#method_createRecord) is used for creating new\n    records on the client side. This will return a new record in the\n    `created.uncommitted` state. In order to persist this record to the\n    backend you will need to call `record.save()`.\n  \n    [push](#method_push) is used to notify Ember Data's store of new or\n    updated records that exist in the backend. This will return a record\n    in the `loaded.saved` state. The primary use-case for `store#push` is\n    to notify Ember Data about record updates (full or partial) that happen\n    outside of the normal adapter methods (for example\n    [SSE](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) or [Web\n    Sockets](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-websockets-20091222/)).\n  \n    [pushPayload](#method_pushPayload) is a convenience wrapper for\n    `store#push` that will deserialize payloads if the\n    Serializer implements a `pushPayload` method.\n  \n    Note: When creating a new record using any of the above methods\n    Ember Data will update `DS.RecordArray`s such as those returned by\n    `store#peekAll()`, `store#findAll()` or `store#filter()`. This means any\n    data bindings or computed properties that depend on the RecordArray\n    will automatically be synced to include the new or updated record\n    values.\n  \n    @class Store\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends Ember.Service\n  */\n  exports.Store = Store = Service.extend({\n\n    /**\n      @method init\n      @private\n    */\n    init: function init() {\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      this._backburner = new Backburner(['normalizeRelationships', 'syncRelationships', 'finished']);\n      // internal bookkeeping; not observable\n      this.typeMaps = {};\n      this.recordArrayManager = _emberDataPrivateSystemRecordArrayManager['default'].create({\n        store: this\n      });\n      this._pendingSave = [];\n      this._instanceCache = new _emberDataPrivateSystemStoreContainerInstanceCache['default']((0, _emberDataPrivateUtils.getOwner)(this));\n      //Used to keep track of all the find requests that need to be coalesced\n      this._pendingFetch = Map.create();\n    },\n\n    /**\n      The adapter to use to communicate to a backend server or other persistence layer.\n       This can be specified as an instance, class, or string.\n       If you want to specify `app/adapters/custom.js` as a string, do:\n       ```js\n      adapter: 'custom'\n      ```\n       @property adapter\n      @default DS.JSONAPIAdapter\n      @type {(DS.Adapter|String)}\n    */\n    adapter: '-json-api',\n\n    /**\n      Returns a JSON representation of the record using a custom\n      type-specific serializer, if one exists.\n       The available options are:\n       * `includeId`: `true` if the record's ID should be included in\n        the JSON representation\n       @method serialize\n      @private\n      @param {DS.Model} record the record to serialize\n      @param {Object} options an options hash\n    */\n    serialize: function serialize(record, options) {\n      var snapshot = record._internalModel.createSnapshot();\n      return snapshot.serialize(options);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      This property returns the adapter, after resolving a possible\n      string key.\n       If the supplied `adapter` was a class, or a String property\n      path resolved to a class, this property will instantiate the\n      class.\n       This property is cacheable, so the same instance of a specified\n      adapter class should be used for the lifetime of the store.\n       @property defaultAdapter\n      @private\n      @return DS.Adapter\n    */\n    defaultAdapter: _ember['default'].computed('adapter', function () {\n      var adapter = get(this, 'adapter');\n\n      (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.assert)('You tried to set `adapter` property to an instance of `DS.Adapter`, where it should be a name', typeof adapter === 'string');\n\n      adapter = this.retrieveManagedInstance('adapter', adapter);\n\n      return adapter;\n    }),\n\n    // .....................\n    // .

If the record is already present in the\n      store, it depends on the reload behavior _when_ the returned promise\n      resolves.\n       ### Reloading\n       The reload behavior is configured either via the passed `options` hash or\n      the result of the adapter's `shouldReloadRecord`.\n       If `{ reload: true }` is passed or `adapter.shouldReloadRecord` evaluates\n      to `true`, then the returned promise resolves once the adapter returns\n      data, regardless if the requested record is already in the store:\n       ```js\n      store.push({\n        data: {\n          id: 1,\n          type: 'post',\n          revision: 1\n        }\n      });\n       // adapter#findRecord resolves with\n      // [\n      //   {\n      //     id: 1,\n      //     type: 'post',\n      //     revision: 2\n      //   }\n      // ]\n      store.findRecord('post', 1, { reload: true }).then(function(post) {\n        post.get(\"revision\"); // 2\n      });\n      ```\n       If no reload is indicated via the abovementioned ways, then the promise\n      immediately resolves with the cached version in the store.\n       ### Background Reloading\n       Optionally, if `adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadRecord` evaluates to `true`,\n      then a background reload is started, which updates the records' data, once\n      it is available:\n       ```js\n      // app/adapters/post.js\n      import ApplicationAdapter from \"./application\";\n       export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({\n        shouldReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {\n          return false;\n        },\n         shouldBackgroundReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {\n          return true;\n        }\n      });\n       // ...\n       store.push({\n        data: {\n          id: 1,\n          type: 'post',\n          revision: 1\n        }\n      });\n       var blogPost = store.findRecord('post', 1).then(function(post) {\n        post.get('revision'); // 1\n      });\n       // later, once adapter#findRecord resolved with\n      // [\n      //   {\n      //     id: 1,\n      //     type: 'post',\n      //     revision: 2\n      //   }\n      // ]\n       blogPost.get('revision'); // 2\n      ```\n       If you would like to force or prevent background reloading, you can set a\n      boolean value for `backgroundReload` in the options object for\n      `findRecord`.\n       ```app/routes/post/edit.js\n      import Ember from 'ember';\n       export default Ember.Route.extend({\n        model: function(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { backgroundReload: false });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n      If you pass an object on the `adapterOptions` property of the options\n     argument it will be passed to you adapter via the snapshot\n       ```app/routes/post/edit.js\n      import Ember from 'ember';\n       export default Ember.Route.extend({\n        model: function(params) {\n          return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, {\n            adapterOptions: { subscribe: false }\n          });\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/adapters/post.js\n      import MyCustomAdapter from './custom-adapter';\n       export default MyCustomAdapter.extend({\n        findRecord: function(store, type, id, snapshot) {\n          if (snapshot.adapterOptions.subscribe) {\n            // ...\n          }\n          // ...\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       See [peekRecord](#method_peekRecord) to get the cached version of a record.\n       @since 1.13.0\n      @method findRecord\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @param {(String|Integer)} id\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    findRecord: function findRecord(modelName, id, options) {\n      (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.assert)(\"You need to pass a model name to the store's findRecord method\", isPresent(modelName));\n      (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.assert)('Passing classes to store methods has been removed.

So if you override `buildURL` in your app\n      `groupRecordsForFindMany` more likely should be overridden as well in order for coalescing to work.\n       @property coalesceFindRequests\n      @type {boolean}\n    */\n    coalesceFindRequests: false,\n\n    /**\n      @method findMany\n      @param {DS.Store} store\n      @param {DS.Model} type\n      @param {Array} ids\n      @param {Array} snapshots\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    findMany: function findMany(store, type, ids, snapshots) {\n      if (false && !this._hasCustomizedAjax()) {\n        return this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      } else {\n        var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, ids, snapshots, 'findMany');\n        return this.ajax(url, 'GET', { data: { filter: { id: ids.join(',') } } });\n      }\n    },\n\n    /**\n      @method pathForType\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @return {String} path\n    **/\n    pathForType: function pathForType(modelName) {\n      var dasherized = _ember['default'].String.dasherize(modelName);\n      return _ember['default'].String.pluralize(dasherized);\n    },\n\n    // TODO: Remove this once we have a better way to override HTTP verbs.\n    /**\n      @method updateRecord\n      @param {DS.Store} store\n      @param {DS.Model} type\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @return {Promise} promise\n    */\n    updateRecord: function updateRecord(store, type, snapshot) {\n      if (false && !this._hasCustomizedAjax()) {\n        return this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      } else {\n        var data = {};\n        var serializer = store.serializerFor(type.modelName);\n\n        serializer.serializeIntoHash(data, type, snapshot, { includeId: true });\n\n        var id = snapshot.id;\n        var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, id, snapshot, 'updateRecord');\n\n        return this.ajax(url, 'PATCH', { data: data });\n      }\n    },\n\n    _hasCustomizedAjax: function _hasCustomizedAjax() {\n      if (this.ajax !== JSONAPIAdapter.prototype.ajax) {\n        (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.deprecate)('JSONAPIAdapter#ajax has been deprecated please use. `methodForRequest`, `urlForRequest`, `headersForRequest` or `dataForRequest` instead.', false, {\n          id: 'ds.json-api-adapter.ajax',\n          until: '3.0.0'\n        });\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      if (this.ajaxOptions !== JSONAPIAdapter.prototype.ajaxOptions) {\n        (0, _emberDataPrivateDebug.deprecate)('JSONAPIAdapterr#ajaxOptions has been deprecated please use. `methodForRequest`, `urlForRequest`, `headersForRequest` or `dataForRequest` instead.', false, {\n          id: 'ds.json-api-adapter.ajax-options',\n          until: '3.0.0'\n        });\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      return false;\n    }\n  });\n\n  if (false) {\n\n    JSONAPIAdapter.reopen({\n\n      methodForRequest: function methodForRequest(params) {\n        if (params.requestType === 'updateRecord') {\n          return 'PATCH';\n        }\n\n        return this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      },\n\n      dataForRequest: function dataForRequest(params) {\n        var requestType = params.requestType;\n        var ids = params.ids;\n\n        if (requestType === 'findMany') {\n          return {\n            filter: { id: ids.join(',') }\n          };\n        }\n\n        if (requestType === 'updateRecord') {\n          var store = params.store;\n          var type = params.type;\n          var snapshot = params.snapshot;\n\n          var data = {};\n          var serializer = store.serializerFor(type.modelName);\n\n          serializer.serializeIntoHash(data, type, snapshot, { includeId: true });\n\n          return data;\n        }\n\n        return this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      },\n\n      headersForRequest: function headersForRequest() {\n        var headers = this._super.apply(this, arguments) || {};\n\n        headers['Accept'] = 'application/vnd.api+json';\n\n        return headers;\n      },\n\n      _requestToJQueryAjaxHash: function _requestToJQueryAjaxHash() {\n        var hash = this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n        if (hash.contentType) {\n          hash.contentType = 'application/vnd.api+json';\n        }\n\n        return hash;\n      }\n\n    });\n  }\n\n  exports['default'] = JSONAPIAdapter;\n});","define('ember-data/adapters/rest', ['exports', 'ember', 'ember-data/adapter', 'ember-data/adapters/errors', 'ember-data/-private/adapters/build-url-mixin', 'ember-data/-private/features', 'ember-data/-private/debug', 'ember-data/-private/utils/parse-response-headers'], function (exports, _ember, _emberDataAdapter, _emberDataAdaptersErrors, _emberDataPrivateAdaptersBuildUrlMixin, _emberDataPrivateFeatures, _emberDataPrivateDebug, _emberDataPrivateUtilsParseResponseHeaders) {\n  /**\n    @module ember-data\n  */\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  function _instanceof(left, right) { if (right != null && right[Symbol.hasInstance]) { return right[Symbol.hasInstance](left);

Most Ember.js apps that consume a JSON API\n    should use the REST adapter.\n  \n    This adapter is designed around the idea that the JSON exchanged with\n    the server should be conventional.\n  \n    ## Success and failure\n  \n    The REST adapter will consider a success any response with a status code\n    of the 2xx family (\"Success\"), as well as 304 (\"Not Modified\"). Any other\n    status code will be considered a failure.\n  \n    On success, the request promise will be resolved with the full response\n    payload.\n  \n    Failed responses with status code 422 (\"Unprocessable Entity\") will be\n    considered \"invalid\". The response will be discarded, except for the\n    `errors` key. The request promise will be rejected with a `DS.InvalidError`.\n    This error object will encapsulate the saved `errors` value.\n  \n    Any other status codes will be treated as an \"adapter error\". The request\n    promise will be rejected, similarly to the \"invalid\" case, but with\n    an instance of `DS.AdapterError` instead.\n  \n    ## JSON Structure\n  \n    The REST adapter expects the JSON returned from your server to follow\n    these conventions.\n  \n    ### Object Root\n  \n    The JSON payload should be an object that contains the record inside a\n    root property. For example, in response to a `GET` request for\n    `/posts/1`, the JSON should look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"post\": {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n        \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Similarly, in response to a `GET` request for `/posts`, the JSON should\n    look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"posts\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": 1,\n          \"title\": \"I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag\",\n          \"author\": \"Yehuda Katz\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": 2,\n          \"title\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n          \"author\": \"D2H\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Note that the object root can be pluralized for both a single-object response\n    and an array response: the REST adapter is not strict on this. Further, if the\n    HTTP server responds to a `GET` request to `/posts/1` (e.g. the response to a\n    `findRecord` query) with more than one object in the array, Ember Data will\n    only display the object with the matching ID.\n  \n    ### Conventional Names\n  \n    Attribute names in your JSON payload should be the camelCased versions of\n    the attributes in your Ember.js models.\n  \n    For example, if you have a `Person` model:\n  \n    ```app/models/person.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      firstName: DS.attr('string'),\n      lastName: DS.attr('string'),\n      occupation: DS.attr('string')\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The JSON returned should look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"person\": {\n        \"id\": 5,\n        \"firstName\": \"Barack\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Obama\",\n        \"occupation\": \"President\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ### Errors\n  \n    If a response is considered a failure, the JSON payload is expected to include\n    a top-level key `errors`, detailing any specific issues. For example:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      \"errors\": {\n        \"msg\": \"Something went wrong\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    This adapter does not make any assumptions as to the format of the `errors`\n    object. It will simply be passed along as is, wrapped in an instance\n    of `DS.InvalidError` or `DS.AdapterError`. The serializer can interpret it\n    afterwards.\n  \n    ## Customization\n  \n    ### Endpoint path customization\n  \n    Endpoint paths can be prefixed with a `namespace` by setting the namespace\n    property on the adapter:\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      namespace: 'api/1'\n    });\n    ```\n    Requests for the `Person` model would now target `/api/1/people/1`.\n  \n    ### Host customization\n  \n    An adapter can target other hosts by setting the `host` property.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      host: 'https://api.example.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Headers customization\n  \n    Some APIs require HTTP headers, e.g. to provide an API key. Arbitrary\n    headers can be set as key/value pairs on the `RESTAdapter`'s `headers`\n    object and Ember Data will send them along with each ajax request.\n  \n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: {\n        \"API_KEY\": \"secret key\",\n        \"ANOTHER_HEADER\": \"Some header value\"\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    `headers` can also be used as a computed property to support dynamic\n    headers. In the example below, the `session` object has been\n    injected into an adapter by Ember's container.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: Ember.computed('session.authToken', function() {\n        return {\n          \"API_KEY\": this.get(\"session.authToken\"),\n          \"ANOTHER_HEADER\": \"Some header value\"\n        };\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    In some cases, your dynamic headers may require data from some\n    object outside of Ember's observer system (for example\n    `document.cookie`). You can use the\n    [volatile](/api/classes/Ember.ComputedProperty.html#method_volatile)\n    function to set the property into a non-cached mode causing the headers to\n    be recomputed with every request.\n  \n    ```app/adapters/application.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n      headers: Ember.computed(function() {\n        return {\n          \"API_KEY\": Ember.get(document.cookie.match(/apiKey\\=([^;]*)/), \"1\"),\n          \"ANOTHER_HEADER\": \"Some header value\"\n        };\n      }).volatile()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class RESTAdapter\n    @constructor\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends DS.Adapter\n    @uses DS.BuildURLMixin\n  */\n  var RESTAdapter = _emberDataAdapter['default'].extend(_emberDataPrivateAdaptersBuildUrlMixin['default'], {\n    defaultSerializer: '-rest',\n\n    /**\n      By default, the RESTAdapter will send the query params sorted alphabetically to the\n      server.\n       For example:\n       ```js\n        store.query('posts', { sort: 'price', category: 'pets' });\n      ```\n       will generate a requests like this `/posts?category=pets&sort=price`, even if the\n      parameters were specified in a different order.\n       That way the generated URL will be deterministic and that simplifies caching mechanisms\n      in the backend.\n       Setting `sortQueryParams` to a falsey value will respect the original order.\n       In case you want to sort the query parameters with a different criteria, set\n      `sortQueryParams` to your custom sort function.\n       ```app/adapters/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({\n        sortQueryParams: function(params) {\n          var sortedKeys = Object.keys(params).sort().reverse();\n          var len = sortedKeys.length, newParams = {};\n           for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            newParams[sortedKeys[i]] = params[sortedKeys[i]];\n          }\n          return newParams;\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method sortQueryParams\n      @param {Object} obj\n      @return {Object}\n    */\n    sortQueryParams: function sortQueryParams(obj) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(obj);\n      var len = keys.length;\n      if (len < 2) {\n        return obj;\n      }\n      var newQueryParams = {};\n      var sortedKeys = keys.sort();\n\n      for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        newQueryParams[sortedKeys[i]] = obj[sortedKeys[i]];\n      }\n      return newQueryParams;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      By default the RESTAdapter will send each find request coming from a `store.find`\n      or from accessing a relationship separately to the server. If your server supports passing\n      ids as a query string, you can set coalesceFindRequests to true to coalesce all find requests\n      within a single runloop.\n       For example, if you have an initial payload of:\n       ```javascript\n      {\n        post: {\n          id: 1,\n          comments: [1, 2]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       By default calling `post.get('comments')` will trigger the following requests(assuming the\n      comments haven't been loaded before):\n       ```\n      GET /comments/1\n      GET /comments/2\n      ```\n       If you set coalesceFindRequests to `true` it will instead trigger the following request:\n       ```\n      GET /comments?ids[]=1&ids[]=2\n      ```\n       Setting coalesceFindRequests to `true` also works for `store.find` requests and `belongsTo`\n      relationships accessed within the same runloop. If you set `coalesceFindRequests: true`\n       ```javascript\n      store.findRecord('comment', 1);\n      store.findRecord('comment', 2);\n      ```\n       will also send a request to: `GET /comments?ids[]=1&ids[]=2`\n       Note: Requests coalescing rely on URL building strategy.

You can define your own transforms by subclassing\n    [DS.Transform](/api/data/classes/DS.Transform.html).\n  \n    Note that you cannot use `attr` to define an attribute of `id`.\n  \n    `DS.attr` takes an optional hash as a second parameter, currently\n    supported options are:\n  \n    - `defaultValue`: Pass a string or a function to be called to set the attribute\n                      to a default value if none is supplied.\n  \n    Example\n  \n    ```app/models/user.js\n    import DS from 'ember-data';\n  \n    export default DS.Model.extend({\n      username: DS.attr('string'),\n      email: DS.attr('string'),\n      verified: DS.attr('boolean', { defaultValue: false })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Default value can also be a function.

Nevertheless,\n    using `{ embedded: 'always' }` as an option to `DS.attr` is not a valid way to setup\n    embedded records.\n  \n    The `attrs` option for a resource `{ embedded: 'always' }` is shorthand for:\n  \n    ```js\n    {\n      serialize: 'records',\n      deserialize: 'records'\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ### Configuring Attrs\n  \n    A resource's `attrs` option may be set to use `ids`, `records` or false for the\n    `serialize`  and `deserialize` settings.\n  \n    The `attrs` property can be set on the `ApplicationSerializer` or a per-type\n    serializer.\n  \n    In the case where embedded JSON is expected while extracting a payload (reading)\n    the setting is `deserialize: 'records'`, there is no need to use `ids` when\n    extracting as that is the default behavior without this mixin if you are using\n    the vanilla `EmbeddedRecordsMixin`. Likewise, to embed JSON in the payload while\n    serializing `serialize: 'records'` is the setting to use. There is an option of\n    not embedding JSON in the serialized payload by using `serialize: 'ids'`. If you\n    do not want the relationship sent at all, you can use `serialize: false`.\n  \n  \n    ### EmbeddedRecordsMixin defaults\n    If you do not overwrite `attrs` for a specific relationship, the `EmbeddedRecordsMixin`\n    will behave in the following way:\n  \n    BelongsTo: `{ serialize: 'id', deserialize: 'id' }`\n    HasMany:   `{ serialize: false, deserialize: 'ids' }`\n  \n    ### Model Relationships\n  \n    Embedded records must have a model defined to be extracted and serialized. Note that\n    when defining any relationships on your model such as `belongsTo` and `hasMany`, you\n    should not both specify `async: true` and also indicate through the serializer's\n    `attrs` attribute that the related model should be embedded for deserialization.\n    If a model is declared embedded for deserialization (`embedded: 'always'` or `deserialize: 'records'`),\n    then do not use `async: true`.\n  \n    To successfully extract and serialize embedded records the model relationships\n    must be setup correcty. See the\n    [defining relationships](/guides/models/defining-models/#toc_defining-relationships)\n    section of the **Defining Models** guide page.\n  \n    Records without an `id` property are not considered embedded records, model\n    instances must have an `id` property to be used with Ember Data.\n  \n    ### Example JSON payloads, Models and Serializers\n  \n    **When customizing a serializer it is important to grok what the customizations\n    are. Please read the docs for the methods this mixin provides, in case you need\n    to modify it to fit your specific needs.**\n  \n    For example review the docs for each method of this mixin:\n    *

embedded records can serialize\n      the records together under the root attribute's payload:\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"post\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\"\n          \"title\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n          \"body\": \"I want this for my ORM, I want that for my template language...\"\n          \"comments\": [{\n            \"id\": \"1\",\n            \"body\": \"Rails is unagi\"\n          }, {\n            \"id\": \"2\",\n            \"body\": \"Omakase O_o\"\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       The attrs options object can use more specific instruction for extracting and\n      serializing. When serializing, an option to embed `ids`, `ids-and-types` or `records` can be set.\n      When extracting the only option is `records`.\n       So `{ embedded: 'always' }` is shorthand for:\n      `{ serialize: 'records', deserialize: 'records' }`\n       To embed the `ids` for a related object (using a hasMany relationship):\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data;\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {\n        attrs: {\n          comments: { serialize: 'ids', deserialize: 'records' }\n        }\n      })\n      ```\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"post\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\"\n          \"title\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n          \"body\": \"I want this for my ORM, I want that for my template language...\"\n          \"comments\": [\"1\", \"2\"]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       To embed the relationship as a collection of objects with `id` and `type` keys, set\n      `ids-and-types` for the related object.\n       This is particularly useful for polymorphic relationships where records don't share\n      the same table and the `id` is not enough information.\n       By example having a user that has many pets:\n       ```js\n      User = DS.Model.extend({\n        name:    DS.attr('string'),\n        pets: DS.hasMany('pet', { polymorphic: true })\n      });\n       Pet = DS.Model.extend({\n        name: DS.attr('string'),\n      });\n       Cat = Pet.extend({\n        // ...\n      });\n       Parrot = Pet.extend({\n        // ...\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/serializers/user.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data;\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {\n        attrs: {\n          pets: { serialize: 'ids-and-types', deserialize: 'records' }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\"\n          \"name\": \"Bertin Osborne\",\n          \"pets\": [\n            { \"id\": \"1\", \"type\": \"Cat\" },\n            { \"id\": \"1\", \"type\": \"Parrot\"}\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       @method serializeHasMany\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} json\n      @param {Object} relationship\n    */\n    serializeHasMany: function serializeHasMany(snapshot, json, relationship) {\n      var attr = relationship.key;\n      if (this.noSerializeOptionSpecified(attr)) {\n        this._super(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (this.hasSerializeIdsOption(attr)) {\n        var serializedKey = this._getMappedKey(relationship.key, snapshot.type);\n        if (serializedKey === relationship.key && this.keyForRelationship) {\n          serializedKey = this.keyForRelationship(relationship.key, relationship.kind, \"serialize\");\n        }\n\n        json[serializedKey] = snapshot.hasMany(attr, { ids: true });\n      } else if (this.hasSerializeRecordsOption(attr)) {\n        this._serializeEmbeddedHasMany(snapshot, json, relationship);\n      } else {\n        if (this.hasSerializeIdsAndTypesOption(attr)) {\n          this._serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        }\n      }\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Serializes a hasMany relationship as an array of objects containing only `id` and `type`\n      keys.\n      This has its use case on polymorphic hasMany relationships where the server is not storing\n      all records in the same table using STI, and therefore the `id` is not enough information\n       TODO: Make the default in Ember-data 3.0??\n    */\n    _serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes: function _serializeHasManyAsIdsAndTypes(snapshot, json, relationship) {\n      var serializedKey = this.keyForAttribute(relationship.key, 'serialize');\n      var hasMany = snapshot.hasMany(relationship.key);\n\n      json[serializedKey] = _ember['default'].A(hasMany).map(function (recordSnapshot) {\n        //\n        // I'm sure I'm being utterly naive here.

This is the method you most likely want to subclass.\n      - `extractId` | `extractAttributes` | `extractRelationships` - `normalize` delegates to these methods to\n        turn the record payload into the JSON API format.\n  \n    @class JSONSerializer\n    @namespace DS\n    @extends DS.Serializer\n  */\n  var JSONSerializer = _emberDataSerializer['default'].extend({\n\n    /**\n      The `primaryKey` is used when serializing and deserializing\n      data.

Omakase? O_O\",\n        \"author\": 12\n      }\n      ```\n       By default, attributes are passed through as-is, unless\n      you specified an attribute type (`DS.attr('date')`). If\n      you specify a transform, the JavaScript value will be\n      serialized when inserted into the JSON hash.\n       By default, belongs-to relationships are converted into\n      IDs when inserted into the JSON hash.\n       ## IDs\n       `serialize` takes an options hash with a single option:\n      `includeId`. If this option is `true`, `serialize` will,\n      by default include the ID in the JSON object it builds.\n       The adapter passes in `includeId: true` when serializing\n      a record for `createRecord`, but not for `updateRecord`.\n       ## Customization\n       Your server may expect a different JSON format than the\n      built-in serialization format.\n       In that case, you can implement `serialize` yourself and\n      return a JSON hash of your choosing.\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = {\n            POST_TTL: snapshot.attr('title'),\n            POST_BDY: snapshot.attr('body'),\n            POST_CMS: snapshot.hasMany('comments', { ids: true })\n          }\n           if (options.includeId) {\n            json.POST_ID_ = snapshot.id;\n          }\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ## Customizing an App-Wide Serializer\n       If you want to define a serializer for your entire\n      application, you'll probably want to use `eachAttribute`\n      and `eachRelationship` on the record.\n       ```app/serializers/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = {};\n           snapshot.eachAttribute(function(name) {\n            json[serverAttributeName(name)] = snapshot.attr(name);\n          })\n           snapshot.eachRelationship(function(name, relationship) {\n            if (relationship.kind === 'hasMany') {\n              json[serverHasManyName(name)] = snapshot.hasMany(name, { ids: true });\n            }\n          });\n           if (options.includeId) {\n            json.ID_ = snapshot.id;\n          }\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n       function serverAttributeName(attribute) {\n        return attribute.underscore().toUpperCase();\n      }\n       function serverHasManyName(name) {\n        return serverAttributeName(name.singularize()) + \"_IDS\";\n      }\n      ```\n       This serializer will generate JSON that looks like this:\n       ```javascript\n      {\n        \"TITLE\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n        \"BODY\": \"Yep. Omakase.\",\n        \"COMMENT_IDS\": [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n      }\n      ```\n       ## Tweaking the Default JSON\n       If you just want to do some small tweaks on the default JSON,\n      you can call super first and make the tweaks on the returned\n      JSON.\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n           json.subject = json.title;\n          delete json.title;\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method serialize\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Object} json\n    */\n    serialize: function serialize(snapshot, options) {\n      var _this6 = this;\n\n      var json = {};\n\n      if (options && options.includeId) {\n        var id = snapshot.id;\n\n        if (id) {\n          json[get(this, 'primaryKey')] = id;\n        }\n      }\n\n      snapshot.eachAttribute(function (key, attribute) {\n        _this6.serializeAttribute(snapshot, json, key, attribute);\n      });\n\n      snapshot.eachRelationship(function (key, relationship) {\n        if (relationship.kind === 'belongsTo') {\n          _this6.serializeBelongsTo(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        } else if (relationship.kind === 'hasMany') {\n          _this6.serializeHasMany(snapshot, json, relationship);\n        }\n      });\n\n      return json;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      You can use this method to customize how a serialized record is added to the complete\n      JSON hash to be sent to the server.

This means that a payload key like \"blogPost\" would be\n      normalized to \"blog-post\" when Ember Data looks up the model. Usually, Ember Data\n      can use the correct inflection to do this for you. Most of the time, you won't\n      need to override `modelNameFromPayloadKey` for this purpose.\n       @method modelNameFromPayloadKey\n      @param {String} key\n      @return {String} the model's modelName\n    */\n    modelNameFromPayloadKey: function modelNameFromPayloadKey(key) {\n      return (0, _emberInflector.singularize)((0, _emberDataPrivateSystemNormalizeModelName[\"default\"])(key));\n    },\n\n    // SERIALIZE\n\n    /**\n      Called when a record is saved in order to convert the\n      record into JSON.\n       By default, it creates a JSON object with a key for\n      each attribute and belongsTo relationship.\n       For example, consider this model:\n       ```app/models/comment.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.Model.extend({\n        title: DS.attr(),\n        body: DS.attr(),\n         author: DS.belongsTo('user')\n      });\n      ```\n       The default serialization would create a JSON object like:\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Rails is unagi\",\n        \"body\": \"Rails? Omakase? O_O\",\n        \"author\": 12\n      }\n      ```\n       By default, attributes are passed through as-is, unless\n      you specified an attribute type (`DS.attr('date')`). If\n      you specify a transform, the JavaScript value will be\n      serialized when inserted into the JSON hash.\n       By default, belongs-to relationships are converted into\n      IDs when inserted into the JSON hash.\n       ## IDs\n       `serialize` takes an options hash with a single option:\n      `includeId`. If this option is `true`, `serialize` will,\n      by default include the ID in the JSON object it builds.\n       The adapter passes in `includeId: true` when serializing\n      a record for `createRecord`, but not for `updateRecord`.\n       ## Customization\n       Your server may expect a different JSON format than the\n      built-in serialization format.\n       In that case, you can implement `serialize` yourself and\n      return a JSON hash of your choosing.\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = {\n            POST_TTL: snapshot.attr('title'),\n            POST_BDY: snapshot.attr('body'),\n            POST_CMS: snapshot.hasMany('comments', { ids: true })\n          }\n           if (options.includeId) {\n            json.POST_ID_ = snapshot.id;\n          }\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ## Customizing an App-Wide Serializer\n       If you want to define a serializer for your entire\n      application, you'll probably want to use `eachAttribute`\n      and `eachRelationship` on the record.\n       ```app/serializers/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = {};\n           snapshot.eachAttribute(function(name) {\n            json[serverAttributeName(name)] = snapshot.attr(name);\n          })\n           snapshot.eachRelationship(function(name, relationship) {\n            if (relationship.kind === 'hasMany') {\n              json[serverHasManyName(name)] = snapshot.hasMany(name, { ids: true });\n            }\n          });\n           if (options.includeId) {\n            json.ID_ = snapshot.id;\n          }\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n       function serverAttributeName(attribute) {\n        return attribute.underscore().toUpperCase();\n      }\n       function serverHasManyName(name) {\n        return serverAttributeName(name.singularize()) + \"_IDS\";\n      }\n      ```\n       This serializer will generate JSON that looks like this:\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"TITLE\": \"Rails is omakase\",\n        \"BODY\": \"Yep. Omakase.\",\n        \"COMMENT_IDS\": [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n      }\n      ```\n       ## Tweaking the Default JSON\n       If you just want to do some small tweaks on the default JSON,\n      you can call super first and make the tweaks on the returned\n      JSON.\n       ```app/serializers/post.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n        serialize: function(snapshot, options) {\n          var json = this._super(snapshot, options);\n           json.subject = json.title;\n          delete json.title;\n           return json;\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method serialize\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Object} json\n    */\n    serialize: function serialize(snapshot, options) {\n      return this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      You can use this method to customize the root keys serialized into the JSON.\n      The hash property should be modified by reference (possibly using something like _.extend)\n      By default the REST Serializer sends the modelName of a model, which is a camelized\n      version of the name.\n       For example, your server may expect underscored root objects.\n       ```app/serializers/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n        serializeIntoHash: function(data, type, record, options) {\n          var root = Ember.String.decamelize(type.modelName);\n          data[root] = this.serialize(record, options);\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @method serializeIntoHash\n      @param {Object} hash\n      @param {DS.Model} typeClass\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} options\n    */\n    serializeIntoHash: function serializeIntoHash(hash, typeClass, snapshot, options) {\n      var normalizedRootKey = this.payloadKeyFromModelName(typeClass.modelName);\n      hash[normalizedRootKey] = this.serialize(snapshot, options);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      You can use `payloadKeyFromModelName` to override the root key for an outgoing\n      request. By default, the RESTSerializer returns a camelized version of the\n      model's name.\n       For a model called TacoParty, its `modelName` would be the string `taco-party`. The RESTSerializer\n      will send it to the server with `tacoParty` as the root key in the JSON payload:\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"tacoParty\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\",\n          \"location\": \"Matthew Beale's House\"\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       For example, your server may expect dasherized root objects:\n       ```app/serializers/application.js\n      import DS from 'ember-data';\n       export default DS.RESTSerializer.extend({\n        payloadKeyFromModelName: function(modelName) {\n          return Ember.String.dasherize(modelName);\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       Given a `TacoParty` model, calling `save` on it would produce an outgoing\n      request like:\n       ```js\n      {\n        \"taco-party\": {\n          \"id\": \"1\",\n          \"location\": \"Matthew Beale's House\"\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n       @method payloadKeyFromModelName\n      @param {String} modelName\n      @return {String}\n    */\n    payloadKeyFromModelName: function payloadKeyFromModelName(modelName) {\n      return camelize(modelName);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      You can use this method to customize how polymorphic objects are serialized.\n      By default the REST Serializer creates the key by appending `Type` to\n      the attribute and value from the model's camelcased model name.\n       @method serializePolymorphicType\n      @param {DS.Snapshot} snapshot\n      @param {Object} json\n      @param {Object} relationship\n    */\n    serializePolymorphicType: function serializePolymorphicType(snapshot, json, relationship) {\n      var key = relationship.key;\n      var belongsTo = snapshot.belongsTo(key);\n      var typeKey = this.keyForPolymorphicType(key, relationship.type, 'serialize');\n\n      // old way of getting the key for the polymorphic type\n      key = this.keyForAttribute ? this.keyForAttribute(key, \"serialize\") : key;\n      key = key + \"Type\";\n\n      // The old way of serializing the type of a polymorphic record used\n      // `keyForAttribute`, which is not correct.
